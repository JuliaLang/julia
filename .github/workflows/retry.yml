# Please ping @DilumAluthge when making any changes to this file.

# Here are some steps that we take in this workflow file for security reasons:
# 1. We do not checkout any code.
# 2. We only run actions that are defined in a repository in the `JuliaLang` GitHub organization.
# 3. We do not give the `GITHUB_TOKEN` any permissions.
# 4. We only give the Buildkite API token (`BUILDKITE_API_TOKEN_RETRY`) the minimum necessary
#    set of permissions.

# Important note to Buildkite maintainers:
# In order to make this work, you need to tell Buildkite that it should NOT create a brand-new
# build when someone closes and reopens a pull request. To do so:
# 1. Go to the relevant pipeline (e.g. https://buildkite.com/julialang/julia-master).
# 2. Click on the "Pipeline Settings" button.
# 3. In the left sidebar, under "Pipeline Settings", click on "GitHub".
# 4. In the "GitHub Settings", under "Build Pull Requests", make sure that the "Skip pull
#    request builds for existing commits" checkbox is checked. This is the setting that tells
#    Buildkite that it should NOT create a brand-new build when someone closes and reopens a
#    pull request.
# 5. At the bottom of the page, click the "Save GitHub Settings" button.
