Julia v1.13 Release Notes
========================

New language features
---------------------

  - New `Base.@acquire` macro for a non-closure version of `Base.acquire(f, s::Base.Semaphore)`, like `@lock`. ([#56845])
  - The character U+1F8B2 🢲 (RIGHTWARDS ARROW WITH LOWER HOOK), newly added by Unicode 16,
    is now a valid operator with arrow precedence, accessible as `\hookunderrightarrow` at the REPL.
    ([JuliaLang/JuliaSyntax.jl#525], [#57143])

Language changes
----------------
* `mod(x::AbstractFloat, -Inf)` now returns `x` (as long as `x` is finite), this aligns with C standard and
is considered a bug fix ([#47102])

  - The `hash` algorithm and its values have changed. Most `hash` specializations will remain correct and require no action. Types that reimplement the core hashing logic independently, such as some third-party string packages do, may require a migration to the new algorithm. ([#57509])

Compiler/Runtime improvements
-----------------------------

Command-line option changes
---------------------------

* The option `--sysimage-native-code=no` has been deprecated.

Multi-threading changes
-----------------------

* A new `AbstractSpinLock` is defined with `SpinLock <: AbstractSpinLock` ([#55944]).
* A new `PaddedSpinLock <: AbstractSpinLock` is defined.  It has extra padding to avoid false sharing ([#55944]).
* New types are defined to handle the pattern of code that must run once per process, called
  a `OncePerProcess{T}` type, which allows defining a function that should be run exactly once
  the first time it is called, and then always return the same result value of type `T`
  every subsequent time afterwards. There are also `OncePerThread{T}` and `OncePerTask{T}` types for
  similar usage with threads or tasks. ([#TBD])

Build system changes
--------------------

New library functions
---------------------

* `ispositive(::Real)` and `isnegative(::Real)` are provided for performance and convenience ([#53677]).
* Exporting function `fieldindex` to get the index of a struct's field ([#58119]).

New library features
--------------------

* `fieldoffset` now also accepts the field name as a symbol as `fieldtype` already did ([#58100]).
* `sort(keys(::Dict))` and `sort(values(::Dict))` now automatically collect, they previously threw ([#56978]).
* `Base.AbstractOneTo` is added as a supertype of one-based axes, with `Base.OneTo` as its subtype ([#56902]).
* `takestring!(::IOBuffer)` removes the content from the buffer, returning the content as a `String`.

Standard library changes
------------------------

#### JuliaSyntaxHighlighting

#### LinearAlgebra

#### Profile

#### Random

* `randperm!` and `randcycle!` now support non-`Array` `AbstractArray` inputs, assuming they are mutable and their indices are one-based ([#58596]).

#### REPL

* The display of `AbstractChar`s in the main REPL mode now includes LaTeX input information like what is shown in help mode ([#58181]).

#### Test

* Test failures when using the `@test` macro now show evaluated arguments for all function calls ([#57825], [#57839]).

#### InteractiveUtils

* Introspection utilities such as `@code_typed`, `@which` and `@edit` now accept type annotations as substitutes for values, recognizing forms such as `f(1, ::Float64, 3)` or even `sum(::Vector{T}; init = ::T) where {T<:Real}`. Type-annotated variables as in `f(val::Int; kw::Float64)` are not evaluated if the type annotation provides the necessary information, making this syntax compatible with signatures found in stacktraces ([#57909], [#58222]).
* Code introspection macros such as `@code_lowered` and `@code_typed` now have a much better support for broadcasting expressions, including broadcasting assignments of the form `x .+= f(y)` ([#58349]).
