Welcome to the Julia project!

We use the GitHub issue tracker for bug reports and feature requests.
If you have a question or are unsure if the behavior you're experiencing is a bug,
please search or post to [our Discourse site](https://discourse.julialang.org).

If you're submitting a bug report, be sure to include as much relevant information as
possible, including a minimal reproducible example and the output of `versioninfo()`.
Consider using a [GitHub Gist](https://gist.github.com) if you have a lot of code or output
to include in the report.
If you're experiencing a problem with a particular package, open an issue on that
package's repository instead.

Please delete this message before posting, and thanks for your contribution to Julia!
