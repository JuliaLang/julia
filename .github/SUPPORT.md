# Getting support for Julia

We use the GitHub issue tracker for bug reports and feature requests only. If
what you'd like to do is best described as a bug report or a code contribution
then you should submit a GitHub issue or pull request as usual. Please see our
[Notes for Julia
Contributors](https://github.com/JuliaLang/julia/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)
for how to file a bug report, our contributor checklist and other helpful
information. But if you have come here for help, or if you are unsure whether
the behavior you're experiencing is a bug, then you should see our [Community
page](https://julialang.org/community/) for a list of other places where you can
get support first.
