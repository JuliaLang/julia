# Building Julia on ARM

Julia has been compiled on several ARMv7 / Cortex A15 Samsung
Chromebooks running Ubuntu Linux under Crouton. This is a work in
progress - several tests are known to fail, and backtraces are not
available.

In addition to the standard `build-essentials` toolchain the following
libraries must be installed to build on ARM. On Debian/Ubuntu, use the
following command:

````
sudo apt-get install libblas3gf liblapack3gf libfftw3-dev libgmp3-dev libmpfr-dev libblas-dev liblapack-dev cmake gcc-4.7 g++-4.7 gfortran libgfortran3
````

Please start from the standard [build
instructions](README.md#source-download-and-compilation), in
particular the Linux notes.

Next, create a file in the `julia` top-level directory called
`Make.user` with the following contents:

```
include $(JULIAHOME)/Make.arm
```

Then proceed to build as described in the primary README. Just typing
`make -j 4` at this stage should build julia.

# Installing Crouton for Chromebooks

If you do not have an Ubuntu chroot running on your Chromebook using
Crouton, you can do so by following these tutorials.
