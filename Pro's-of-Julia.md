<h1>Why Julia/Pro's of Julia:</h1>

Today there are many languages we are comming across in the relm of programming. Let's see how julia is unique from other languages.

It is a high level dynamic programming language Julia is a high-level dynamic programming language designed to address the requirements of high-performance numerical.
It is also been used for scientific prgramming for simulating and modeling software in the field of biological,science, humanities and social engineering. 

Like C++, Ada and many others Julia can also be used for doing general purpose programming for writing software in a wide variety of application domains.

It has completely Lisp-like macros and other metaprogramming facilities.

It comes with built-in package manager.

Efficient support for Unicode, including but not limited to UTF-8.

It has multiple dispatch is a generalization of single dispatch â€“ the polymorphic mechanism used in common object oriented (OO) languages.

Julia has packages supporting markup languages such as, HTML (parsing, and also for HTTP), XML, JSON, BSON (and MongoDB) etc.

It can call C functions directly, no wrappers or special APIs.

It is designed for parallelism and distributed computation, this is one of the major advantages of Julia.

Automatic generation of efficient, specialized code for different argument types is present in it.
