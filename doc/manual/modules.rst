Modules in Julia are separate global variable workspaces. They are
delimited syntactically, inside ``module Name ... end``. Modules allow
you to create top-level definitions without worrying about name conflicts
when your code is used together with somebody else's. Within a module, you
can control which names from other modules are visible (via importing),
and specify which of your names are intended to be public (via exporting).

The following example demonstrates the major features of modules. It is
not meant to be run, but is shown for illustrative purposes::

    module MyModule
    using Lib

    using BigLib: thing1, thing2

    import Base.show

    importall OtherLib

    export MyType, foo

    type MyType
        x
    end

    bar(x) = 2x
    foo(a::MyType) = bar(a.x) + 1

    show(io, a::MyType) = print(io, "MyType $(a.x)")
    end

Note that the style is not to indent the body of the module, since
that would typically lead to whole files being indented.

This module defines a type ``MyType``, and two functions. Function
``foo`` and type ``MyType`` are exported, and so will be available for
importing into other modules.  Function ``bar`` is private to
``MyModule``.

The statement ``using Lib`` means that a module called ``Lib`` will be
available for resolving names as needed. When a global variable is
encountered that has no definition in the current module, the system
will search for it among variables exported by ``Lib`` and import it if
it is found there.
This means that all uses of that global within the current module will
resolve to the definition of that variable in ``Lib``.

The statement ``using BigLib: thing1, thing2`` is a syntactic shortcut for
``using BigLib.thing1, BigLib.thing2``.

The ``import`` keyword supports all the same syntax as ``using``, but only
operates on a single name at a time. It does not add modules to be searched
the way ``using`` does. ``import`` also differs from ``using`` in that
functions must be imported using ``import`` to be extended with new methods.

In ``MyModule`` above we wanted to add a method to the standard ``show``
function, so we had to write ``import Base.show``.
Functions whose names are only visible via ``using`` cannot be extended.

The keyword ``importall`` explicitly imports all names exported by the
specified module, as if ``import`` were individually used on all of them.

Once a variable is made visible via ``using`` or ``import``, a module may
not create its own variable with the same name.
Imported variables are read-only; assigning to a global variable always
affects a variable owned by the current module, or else raises an error.


Summary of module usage
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To load a module, two main keywords can be used: ``using`` and ``import``. To understand their differences, consider the following example::

    module MyModule

    export x, y

    x() = "x"
    y() = "y"
    p() = "p"

    end

In this module we export the ``x`` and ``y`` functions (with the keyword ``export``), and also have the non-exported function ``p``. There are several different ways to load the Module and its inner functions into the current workspace:

+------------------------------------+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+------------------------------------------------------------------------+

Modules and files
-----------------

Files and file names are mostly unrelated to modules; modules are associated
only with module expressions.
One can have multiple files per module, and multiple modules per file::

    module Foo

    include("file1.jl")
    include("file2.jl")

    end

Including the same code in different modules provides mixin-like behavior.
One could use this to run the same code with different base definitions,
for example testing code by running it with "safe" versions of some
operators::

    module Normal
    include("mycode.jl")
    end

    module Testing
    include("safe_operators.jl")
    include("mycode.jl")
    end


Standard modules
----------------

There are three important standard modules: Main, Core, and Base.

Main is the top-level module, and Julia starts with Main set as the
current module.  Variables defined at the prompt go in Main, and
``whos()`` lists variables in Main.

Core contains all identifiers considered "built in" to the language, i.e.
part of the core language and not libraries. Every module implicitly
specifies ``using Core``, since you can't do anything without those
definitions.

Base is the standard library (the contents of base/). All modules implicitly
contain ``using Base``, since this is needed in the vast majority of cases.


Default top-level definitions and bare modules
----------------------------------------------

In addition to ``using Base``, all operators are explicitly imported,
since one typically wants to extend operators rather than creating entirely
new definitions of them. A module also automatically contains a definition
of the ``eval`` function, which evaluates expressions within the context of
that module.

If these definitions are not wanted, modules can be defined using the
keyword ``baremodule`` instead. In terms of ``baremodule``, a standard
``module`` looks like this::

    baremodule Mod

    using Base

    importall Base.Operators

    eval(x) = Core.eval(Mod, x)
    eval(m,x) = Core.eval(m, x)

    ...

    end


Relative and absolute module paths
----------------------------------

Given the statement ``using Foo``, the system looks for ``Foo``
within ``Main``. If the module does not exist, the system
attempts to ``require("Foo")``, which typically results in loading
code from an installed package.

However, some modules contain submodules, which means you sometimes
need to access a module that is not directly available in ``Main``.
There are two ways to do this. The first is to use an absolute path,
for example ``using Base.Sort``. The second is to use a relative path,
which makes it easier to import submodules of the current module or
any of its enclosing modules::

    module Parent

    module Utils
    ...
    end

    using .Utils

    ...
    end

Here module ``Parent`` contains a submodule ``Utils``, and code in
``Parent`` wants the contents of ``Utils`` to be visible. This is
done by starting the ``using`` path with a period. Adding more leading
periods moves up additional levels in the module hierarchy. For example
``using ..Utils`` would look for ``Utils`` in ``Parent``'s enclosing
module rather than in ``Parent`` itself.

Note that relative-import qualifiers are only valid in ``using`` and
``import`` statements.

Module file paths
-----------------

The global variable LOAD_PATH contains the directories Julia searches for
modules when calling ``require``. It can be extended using ``push!``::

    push!(LOAD_PATH, "/Path/To/My/Module/")

Putting this statement in the file ``~/.juliarc.jl`` will extend LOAD_PATH
on every Julia startup. Alternatively, the module load path can be
extended by defining the environment variable JULIA_LOAD_PATH.


Namespace miscellanea
---------------------

If a name is qualified (e.g. ``Base.sin``), then it can be accessed even if
it is not exported. This is often useful when debugging.

Macro names are written with ``@`` in import and export statements, e.g.
``import Mod.@mac``. Macros in other modules can be invoked as ``Mod.@mac``
or ``@Mod.mac``.

The syntax ``M.x = y`` does not work to assign a global in another module;
global assignment is always module-local.

A variable can be "reserved" for the current module without assigning to
it by declaring it as ``global x`` at the top level. This can be used to
prevent name conflicts for globals initialized after load time.

Module initialization and precompilation
----------------------------------------

Large modules can take several second to load because executing all of
the statements in a module often involves compiling a large amount of
code.  However, Julia is progressively gaining more ability to cache
the parsed and compiled binary image of a package.  Currently, this
requires one to recompile Julia after modifying the file
``base/userimg.jl`` to require the desired modules, but in a future
version of Julia the module caching will be simpler and more
automated.  In order to make your module work with precompilation,
however, you may need to change your module to explicitly separate any
initialization steps that must occur at *runtime* from steps that can
occur at *compile time*.  For this purpose, Julia allows you to define
an ``__init__()`` function in your module that executes any
initialization steps that must occur at runtime.

In particular, if you define a ``function __init__()`` in a module,
then Julia will call ``__init__()`` immediately *after* the module is
loaded (e.g., by ``import``, ``using``, or ``require``) at runtime for
the *first* time (i.e., ``__init__`` is only called once, and only
after all statements in the module have been executed).  Because it is
called after the module is fully imported, any submodules or other
imported modules have their ``__init__`` functions called *before* the
``__init__`` of the enclosing module.

Two typical uses of ``__init__`` are calling runtime initialization
functions of external C libraries and initializing global constants
that involve pointers returned by external libraries.  For example,
suppose that we are calling a C library ``libfoo`` that requires us
to call a ``foo_init()`` initialization function at runtime.   Suppose
that we also want to define a global constant ``foo_data_ptr`` that
holds the return value of a ``void *foo_data()`` function defined by
``libfoo`` — this constant must be initialized at runtime (not at compile
time) because the pointer address will change from run to run.  You
could accomplish this by defining the following ``__init__`` function
in your module::

    function __init__()
        ccall((:foo_init,:libfoo), Void, ())
        global const foo_data_ptr = ccall((:foo_data,:libfoo), Ptr{Void}, ())
    end

(Notice that it is perfectly possible to define a global constant inside
a function like ``__init__``; this is one of the advantages of using a
dynamic language.)   Obviously, any other constant in your module that
depends on ``foo_data_ptr`` would also have to be initialized in ``__init__``.

Constants involving most Julia objects that are not produced by
``ccall`` do not need to be placed in ``__init__``: their definitions
can be precompiled and loaded from the cached module image.  (This
includes complicated heap-allocated objects like arrays.)  However,
any routine that returns a raw pointer value must be called at runtime
for precompilation to work.  This includes the Julia functions
``cfunction`` and ``pointer``.

Dictionary and set types, or in general anything that depends on the
output of a ``hash(key)`` method, are a trickier case.  In the common
case where the keys are numbers, strings, symbols, ranges, ``Expr``,
or compositions of these types (via arrays, tuples, sets, pairs, etc.)
they are safe to precompile.  However, for a few other key types, such
as ``Function`` or ``DataType`` and generic user-defined types where
you haven't defined a ``hash`` method, the fallback ``hash`` method
depends on the memory address of the object (via its ``object_id``)
and hence may change from run to run.  If you have one of these key
types, or if you aren't sure, to be safe you can initialize dictionary
and set globals from within your ``__init__`` function.
Alternatively, you can use the ``ObjectIdDict`` dictionary type, which
is specially handled by precompilation so that it is safe to
initialize at compile-time.
