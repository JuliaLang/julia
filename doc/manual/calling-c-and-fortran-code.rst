 Calling C and Fortran Code  
****************************

Though most code can be written in Julia, there are many high-quality,
mature libraries for numerical computing already written in C and
Fortran. To allow easy use of this existing code, Julia makes it simple
and efficient to call C and Fortran functions. Julia has a "no
boilerplate" philosophy: functions can be called directly from Julia
without any "glue" code, code generation, or compilation — even from the
interactive prompt. This is accomplished just by making an appropriate call
with ``call`` syntax, which looks like an ordinary function call.

The code to be called must be available as a shared library. Most C and
Fortran libraries ship compiled as shared libraries already, but if you
are compiling the code yourself using GCC (or Clang), you will need to
use the ``-shared`` and ``-fPIC`` options. The machine instructions
generated by Julia's JIT are the same as a native C call would be, so
the resulting overhead is the same as calling a library function from C
code. (Non-library function calls in both C and Julia can be inlined and
thus may have even less overhead than calls to shared library functions.
When both libraries and executables are generated by LLVM, it is
possible to perform whole-program optimizations that can even optimize
across this boundary, but Julia does not yet support that. In the
future, however, it may do so, yielding even greater performance gains.)

Shared libraries and functions are referenced by a tuple of the 
form ``(:function, "library")`` or ``("function", "library")`` where ``function``
is the C-exported function name. ``library`` refers to the shared library
name: shared libraries available in the (platform-specific) load path
will be resolved by name, and if necessary a direct path may be specified.

A function name may be used alone in place of the tuple (just
``:function`` or ``"function"``). In this case the name is resolved within
the current process. This form can be used to call C library functions,
functions in the Julia runtime, or functions in an application linked to
Julia.

Finally, you can use ``ccall`` to actually generate a call to the
library function. Arguments to ``ccall`` are as follows:

1. (:function, "library") pair.
2. Return type, which may be any bits type, including ``Int32``,
   ``Int64``, ``Float64``, or ``Ptr{T}`` for any type parameter ``T``,
   indicating a pointer to values of type ``T``, or just ``Ptr`` for
   ``void*`` "untyped pointer" values.
3. A tuple of input types, like those allowed for the return type.
4. The following arguments, if any, are the actual argument values
   passed to the function.

As a complete but simple example, the following calls the ``clock``
function from the standard C library::

    julia> t = ccall( (:clock, "libc"), Int32, ())
    5380445

    julia> typeof(ans)
    Int32

``clock`` takes no arguments and returns an ``Int32``. One common gotcha
is that a 1-tuple must be written with with a trailing comma. For
example, to call the ``getenv`` function to get a pointer to the value
of an environment variable, one makes a call like this::

    julia> path = ccall( (:getenv, "libc"), Ptr{Uint8}, (Ptr{Uint8},), "SHELL")
    Ptr{Uint8} @0x00007fff5fbfd670

    julia> bytestring(path)
    "/bin/zsh"

Note that the argument type tuple must be written as ``(Ptr{Uint8},)``,
rather than ``(Ptr{Uint8})``. This is because ``(Ptr{Uint8})`` is just
``Ptr{Uint8}``, rather than a 1-tuple containing ``Ptr{Uint8}``::

    julia> (Ptr{Uint8})
    Ptr{Uint8}

    julia> (Ptr{Uint8},)
    (Ptr{Uint8},)

In practice, especially when providing reusable functionality, one
generally wraps ``ccall`` uses in Julia functions that set up arguments
and then check for errors in whatever manner the C or Fortran function
indicates them, propagating to the Julia caller as exceptions. This is
especially important since C and Fortran APIs are notoriously
inconsistent about how they indicate error conditions. For example, the
``getenv`` C library function is wrapped in the following Julia function
in
`env.jl <https://github.com/JuliaLang/julia/blob/master/base/env.jl>`_::

    function getenv(var::String)
      val = ccall( (:getenv, "libc"),
                  Ptr{Uint8}, (Ptr{Uint8},), bytestring(var))
      if val == C_NULL
        error("getenv: undefined variable: ", var)
      end
      bytestring(val)
    end

The C ``getenv`` function indicates an error by returning ``NULL``, but
other standard C functions indicate errors in various different ways,
including by returning -1, 0, 1 and other special values. This wrapper
throws an exception clearly indicating the problem if the caller tries
to get a non-existent environment variable::

    julia> getenv("SHELL")
    "/bin/zsh"

    julia> getenv("FOOBAR")
    getenv: undefined variable: FOOBAR

Here is a slightly more complex example that discovers the local
machine's hostname::

    function gethostname()
      hostname = Array(Uint8, 128)
      ccall( (:gethostname, "libc"), Int32,
            (Ptr{Uint8}, Ulong),
            hostname, length(hostname))
      return bytestring(convert(Ptr{Uint8}, hostname))
    end

This example first allocates an array of bytes, then calls the C library
function ``gethostname`` to fill the array in with the hostname, takes a
pointer to the hostname buffer, and converts the pointer to a Julia
string, assuming that it is a NUL-terminated C string. It is common for
C libraries to use this pattern of requiring the caller to allocate
memory to be passed to the callee and filled in. Allocation of memory
from Julia like this is generally accomplished by creating an
uninitialized array and passing a pointer to its data to the C function.

When calling a Fortran function, all inputs must be passed by reference.

A prefix ``&`` is used to indicate that a pointer to a scalar argument
should be passed instead of the scalar value itself. The following
example computes a dot product using a BLAS function.

::

    function compute_dot(DX::Vector, DY::Vector)
      assert(length(DX) == length(DY))
      n = length(DX)
      incx = incy = 1
      product = ccall( (:ddot_, "libLAPACK"),
                      Float64,
                      (Ptr{Int32}, Ptr{Float64}, Ptr{Int32}, Ptr{Float64}, Ptr{Int32}),
                      &n, DX, &incx, DY, &incy)
      return product
    end

The meaning of prefix ``&`` is not quite the same as in C. In
particular, any changes to the referenced variables will not be visible
in Julia. However, it will not cause any harm for called functions to
attempt such modifications (that is, writing through the passed
pointers). Since this ``&`` is not a real address operator, it may be
used with any syntax, such as ``&0`` or ``&f(x)``.

Note that no C header files are used anywhere in the process. Currently,
it is not possible to pass structs and other non-primitive types from
Julia to C libraries. However, C functions that generate and use opaque
structs types by passing around pointers to them can return such values
to Julia as ``Ptr{Void}``, which can then be passed to other C functions
as ``Ptr{Void}``. Memory allocation and deallocation of such objects
must be handled by calls to the appropriate cleanup routines in the
libraries being used, just like in any C program.

Mapping C Types to Julia
------------------------

Julia automatically inserts calls to the ``convert`` function to convert
each argument to the specified type. For example, the following call::

    ccall( (:foo, "libfoo"), Void, (Int32, Float64),
          x, y)

will behave as if the following were written::

    ccall( (:foo, "libfoo"), Void, (Int32, Float64),
          convert(Int32, x), convert(Float64, y))

When a scalar value is passed with ``&`` as an argument of type
``Ptr{T}``, the value will first be converted to type ``T``.

Array conversions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When an ``Array`` is passed to C as a ``Ptr`` argument, it is
"converted" simply by taking the address of the first element. This is
done in order to avoid copying arrays unnecessarily, and to tolerate the
slight mismatches in pointer types that are often encountered in C APIs
(for example, passing a ``Float64`` array to a function that operates on
uninterpreted bytes).

Therefore, if an ``Array`` contains data in the wrong format, it will
have to be explicitly converted using a call such as ``int32(a)``.

Type correspondences
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

On all systems we currently support, basic C/C++ value types may be
translated to Julia types as follows.

**System-independent:**

-  ``bool`` ⟺ ``Bool``
-  ``char`` ⟺ ``Uint8``
-  ``signed char`` ⟺ ``Int8``
-  ``unsigned char`` ⟺ ``Uint8``
-  ``short`` ⟺ ``Int16``
-  ``unsigned short`` ⟺ ``Uint16``
-  ``int`` ⟺ ``Int32``
-  ``unsigned int`` ⟺ ``Uint32``
-  ``long long`` ⟺ ``Int64``
-  ``unsigned long long`` ⟺ ``Uint64``
-  ``float`` ⟺ ``Float32``
-  ``double`` ⟺ ``Float64``

*Note:* the ``bool`` type is only defined by C++, where it is 8 bits
wide. In C, however, ``int`` is often used for boolean values. Since
``int`` is 32-bits wide (on all supported systems), there is some
potential for confusion here.

A C function declared to return ``void`` will give ``nothing`` in Julia.

**System-dependent:**

-  ``long`` ⟺ ``Int``
-  ``unsigned long`` ⟺ ``Uint``
-  ``size_t`` ⟺ ``Uint``
-  ``wchar_t`` ⟺ ``Char``

*Note:* Although ``wchar_t`` is technically system-dependent, on all the
systems we currently support (UNIX), it is a 32 bits.

C functions that take an arguments of the type ``char**`` can be called
by using a ``Ptr{Ptr{Uint8}}`` type within Julia. For example, C
functions of the form::

    int main(int argc, char **argv);

can be called via the following Julia code::

    argv = [ "a.out", "arg1", "arg2" ]
    ccall(:main, Int32, (Int32, Ptr{Ptr{Uint8}}), length(argv), argv)

Indirect calls
--------------

The first argument to ``call`` can also be an expression evaluated at
run time. In this case, the expression must evaluate to a ``Ptr``,
which will be used as the address of the native function to call. This
behavior occurs when the first ``ccall`` argument contains references
to non-constants, such as local variables or function arguments.
