 Interacting With Julia
************************

Julia comes with a full-featured interactive command-line REPL (read-eval-print loop) built into the ``julia`` executable.  In addition to allowing quick and easy evaluation of Julia statements, it has a searchable history, tab-completion, many helpful keybindings, and dedicated help and shell modes.  The REPL can be started by simply calling julia with no arguments or double-clicking on the executable::

    $ julia
                   _
       _       _ _(_)_     |  A fresh approach to technical computing
      (_)     | (_) (_)    |  Documentation: http://docs.julialang.org
       _ _   _| |_  __ _   |  Type "help()" to list help topics

    julia>

To exit the interactive session, type ``^D`` — the control key together with the ``d`` key on a blank line — or type ``quit()`` followed by the return or enter key. The REPL greets you with a banner and a ``julia>`` prompt.

The different prompt modes
--------------------------

The Julian mode
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The REPL has four main modes of operation.  The first and most common is the Julian prompt.  It is the default mode of operation; each new line initially starts with ``julia>``.  It is here that you can enter Julia expressions.  Hitting return or enter after a complete expression has been entered will evaluate the entry and show the result of the last expression.

.. doctest::

    julia> string(1 + 2)
    "3"

There are a number useful features unique to interactive work. In addition to showing the result, the REPL also binds the result to the variable ``ans``.  A trailing semicolon on the line can be used as a flag to suppress showing the result.

.. doctest::

    julia> string(3 * 4);

    julia> ans
    "12"

Help mode
~~~~~~~~~

When the cursor is at the beginning of the line, the prompt can be changed to a help mode by typing ``?``.  Julia will attempt to print help or documentation for anything entered in help mode::

    julia> ? # upon typing ?, the prompt changes (in place) to: help>

    help> string
    Base.string(xs...)

       Create a string from any values using the "print" function.

In addition to function names, complete function calls may be entered to see which method is called for the given argument(s).  Macros, types and variables can also be queried::

    help> string(1)
    string(x::Union{Int16,Int128,Int8,Int32,Int64}) at string.jl:1553

    help> @printf
    Base.@printf([io::IOStream], "%Fmt", args...)

       Print arg(s) using C "printf()" style format specification
       string. Optionally, an IOStream may be passed as the first argument
       to redirect output.

    help> AbstractString
    DataType   : AbstractString
      supertype: Any
      subtypes : Any[DirectIndexString,RepString,RevString{T<:AbstractString},RopeString,SubString{T<:AbstractString},UTF16String,UTF8String]

Help mode can be exited by pressing backspace at the beginning of the line.

.. _man-shell-mode:

Shell mode
~~~~~~~~~~

Just as help mode is useful for quick access to documentation, another common task is to use the system shell to execute system commands.  Just as ``?`` entered help mode when at the beginning of the line, a semicolon (``;``) will enter the shell mode.  And it can be exited by pressing backspace at the beginning of the line.

::

    julia> ; # upon typing ;, the prompt changes (in place) to: shell>

    shell> echo hello
    hello

Search modes
~~~~~~~~~~~~

In all of the above modes, the executed lines get saved to a history file, which can be searched.  To initiate an incremental search through the previous history, type ``^R`` — the control key together with the ``r`` key.  The prompt will change to ``(reverse-i-search)`':``, and as you type the search query will appear in the quotes.  The most recent result that matches the query will dynamically update to the right of the colon as more is typed.  To find an older result using the same query, simply type ``^R`` again.

Just as ``^R`` is a reverse search, ``^S`` is a forward search, with the prompt ``(i-search)`':``.  The two may be used in conjunction with each other to move through the previous or next matching results, respectively.


Key bindings
------------

The Julia REPL makes great use of key bindings.  Several control-key bindings were already introduced above (``^D`` to exit, ``^R`` and ``^S`` for searching), but there are many more.  In addition to the control-key, there are also meta-key bindings.  These vary more by platform, but most terminals  default to using alt- or option- held down with a key to send the meta-key (or can be configured to do so).

Customizing keybindings
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Julia's REPL keybindings may be fully customized to a user's preferences by passing a dictionary to ``REPL.setup_interface()``. The keys of this dictionary may be characters or strings. The key ``'*'`` refers to the default action. Control plus character ``x`` bindings are indicated with ``"^x"``. Meta plus ``x`` can be written ``"\\Mx"``. The values of the custom keymap must be ``nothing`` (indicating that the input should be ignored) or functions that accept the signature ``(PromptState, AbstractREPL, Char)``. The ``REPL.setup_interface()`` function must be called before the REPL is initialized, by registering the operation with ``atreplinit()``. For example, to bind the up and down arrow keys to move through history without prefix search, one could put the following code in ``.juliarc.jl``::

    import Base: LineEdit, REPL

    const mykeys = Dict{Any,Any}(
      # Up Arrow
      "\e[A" => (s,o...)->(LineEdit.edit_move_up(s) || LineEdit.history_prev(s, LineEdit.mode(s).hist)),
      # Down Arrow
      "\e[B" => (s,o...)->(LineEdit.edit_move_up(s) || LineEdit.history_next(s, LineEdit.mode(s).hist))
    )

    function customize_keys(repl)
      repl.interface = REPL.setup_interface(repl; extra_repl_keymap = mykeys)
    end

    atreplinit(customize_keys)

Users should refer to ``base/LineEdit.jl`` to discover the available actions on key input.

Tab completion
--------------

In both the Julian and help modes of the REPL, one can enter the first few characters of a function or type and then press the tab key to get a list all matches::

    julia> stri
    stride     strides     string      stringmime  strip

    julia> Stri
    StridedArray    StridedVecOrMat  AbstractString
    StridedMatrix   StridedVector

The tab key can also be used to substitute LaTeX math symbols with their Unicode equivalents,
and get a list of LaTeX matches as well::

    julia> \pi[TAB]
    julia> π
    π = 3.1415926535897...

    julia> e\_1[TAB] = [1,0]
    julia> e₁ = [1,0]
    2-element Array{Int64,1}:
     1
     0

    julia> e\^1[TAB] = [1 0]
    julia> e¹ = [1 0]
    1×2 Array{Int64,2}:
     1  0

    julia> \sqrt[TAB]2     # √ is equivalent to the sqrt() function
    julia> √2
    1.4142135623730951

    julia> \hbar[TAB](h) = h / 2\pi[TAB]
    julia> ħ(h) = h / 2π
    ħ (generic function with 1 method)

    julia> \h[TAB]
    \hat              \heartsuit         \hksearow          \hookleftarrow     \hslash
    \hbar             \hermitconjmatrix  \hkswarow          \hookrightarrow    \hspace

A full list of tab-completions can be found in the :ref:`man-unicode-input` section of the manual.


Customizing Colors
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The colors used by Julia and the REPL can be customized, as well. To change the color of the Julia
prompt you can add something like the following to your ``juliarc.jl`` file::

    Base.active_repl.prompt_color = Base.text_colors[:cyan]

The available color keys in ``Base.text_colors`` are ``:black``, ``:red``, ``:green``, ``:yellow``,
``:blue``, ``:magenta``, ``:cyan``, ``:white``, ``:normal``, and ``:bold``. Similarly, you can
change the colors for the help and shell prompts and input and answer text by setting the
appropriate member of ``Base.active_repl`` (respectively, ``help_color``, ``shell_color``,
``input_color``, and ``answer_color``). For the latter two, be sure that the ``envcolors`` member
is also set to false.

You can also customize the color used to render warning and informational messages by
setting the appropriate environment variable. For instance, to render warning messages in yellow and
informational messages in cyan you can add the following to your ``juliarc.jl`` file::

    ENV["JULIA_WARN_COLOR"] = :yellow
    ENV["JULIA_INFO_COLOR"] = :cyan
