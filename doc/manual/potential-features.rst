 Potential Features  
********************

Julia is still a very young programming language, and there are many
features that have been discussed and planned to various extents, but
not yet implemented. This page documents some of these potential future
features, but is likely to be out of date. See the `mailing
list <http://groups.google.com/group/julia-dev>`_ and `GitHub
issues <https://github.com/JuliaLang/julia/issues>`_ for the latest
discussion on potential features.
