{

("Getting Around","Base","exit","exit([code])


   Quit (or control-D at the prompt). The default exit code is zero,
   indicating that the processes completed successfully.

"),

("Getting Around","Base","quit","quit()


   Calls \"exit(0)\".

"),

("Getting Around","Base","atexit","atexit(f)


   Register a zero-argument function to be called at exit.

"),

("Getting Around","Base","isinteractive","isinteractive()


   Determine whether Julia is running an interactive session.

"),

("Getting Around","Base","whos","whos([Module,] [pattern::Regex])


   Print information about global variables in a module, optionally
   restricted to those matching \"pattern\".

"),

("Getting Around","Base","edit","edit(file::String[, line])


   Edit a file optionally providing a line number to edit at. Returns
   to the julia prompt when you quit the editor. If the file name ends
   in \".jl\" it is reloaded when the editor closes the file.

"),

("Getting Around","Base","edit","edit(function[, types])


   Edit the definition of a function, optionally specifying a tuple of
   types to indicate which method to edit. When the editor exits, the
   source file containing the definition is reloaded.

"),

("Getting Around","Base","require","require(file::String...)


   Load source files once, in the context of the \"Main\" module, on
   every active node, searching the system-wide \"LOAD_PATH\" for
   files. \"require\" is considered a top-level operation, so it sets
   the current \"include\" path but does not use it to search for
   files (see help for \"include\"). This function is typically used
   to load library code, and is implicitly called by \"using\" to load
   packages.

"),

("Getting Around","Base","reload","reload(file::String)


   Like \"require\", except forces loading of files regardless of
   whether they have been loaded before. Typically used when
   interactively developing libraries.

"),

("Getting Around","Base","include","include(path::String)


   Evaluate the contents of a source file in the current context.
   During including, a task-local include path is set to the directory
   containing the file. Nested calls to \"include\" will search
   relative to that path. All paths refer to files on node 1 when
   running in parallel, and files will be fetched from node 1. This
   function is typically used to load source interactively, or to
   combine files in packages that are broken into multiple source
   files.

"),

("Getting
Around","Base","include_string","include_string(code::String)


   Like \"include\", except reads code from the given string rather
   than from a file. Since there is no file path involved, no path
   processing or fetching from node 1 is done.

"),

("Getting Around","Base","evalfile","evalfile(path::String)


   Evaluate all expressions in the given file, and return the value of
   the last one. No other processing (path searching, fetching from
   node 1, etc.) is performed.

"),

("Getting Around","Base","usingmodule","usingmodule(name)


   Supports conditional inclusion of a package or module. Equivalent
   to \"using name\" in a file, except it can be inside an \"if\"
   statement.

"),

("Getting Around","Base","help","help(name)


   Get help for a function. \"name\" can be an object or a string.

"),

("Getting Around","Base","apropos","apropos(string)


   Search documentation for functions related to \"string\".

"),

("Getting Around","Base","which","which(f, args...)


   Show which method of \"f\" will be called for the given arguments.

"),

("Getting Around","Base","methods","methods(f)


   Show all methods of \"f\" with their argument types.

"),

("Getting Around","Base","methodswith","methodswith(typ[,
showparents])


   Show all methods with an argument of type \"typ\". If optional
   \"showparents\" is \"true\", also show arguments with a parent type
   of \"typ\", excluding type \"Any\".

"),

("All Objects","Base","is","is(x, y)


   Determine whether \"x\" and \"y\" are identical, in the sense that
   no program could distinguish them.

"),

("All Objects","Base","isa","isa(x, type)


   Determine whether \"x\" is of the given type.

"),

("All Objects","Base","isequal","isequal(x, y)


   True if and only if \"x\" and \"y\" have the same contents. Loosely
   speaking, this means \"x\" and \"y\" would look the same when
   printed.

"),

("All Objects","Base","isless","isless(x, y)


   Test whether \"x\" is less than \"y\". Provides a total order
   consistent with \"isequal\". Values that are normally unordered,
   such as \"NaN\", are ordered in an arbitrary but consistent
   fashion. This is the default comparison used by \"sort\". Non-
   numeric types that can be ordered should implement this function.

"),

("All Objects","Base","typeof","typeof(x)


   Get the concrete type of \"x\".

"),

("All Objects","Base","tuple","tuple(xs...)


   Construct a tuple of the given objects.

"),

("All Objects","Base","ntuple","ntuple(n, f::Function)


   Create a tuple of length \"n\", computing each element as \"f(i)\",
   where \"i\" is the index of the element.

"),

("All Objects","Base","object_id","object_id(x)


   Get a unique integer id for \"x\". \"object_id(x)==object_id(y)\"
   if and only if \"is(x,y)\".

"),

("All Objects","Base","hash","hash(x)


   Compute an integer hash code such that \"isequal(x,y)\" implies
   \"hash(x)==hash(y)\".

"),

("All Objects","Base","finalizer","finalizer(x, function)


   Register a function \"f(x)\" to be called when there are no
   program-accessible references to \"x\". The behavior of this
   function is unpredictable if \"x\" is of a bits type.

"),

("All Objects","Base","copy","copy(x)


   Create a shallow copy of \"x\": the outer structure is copied, but
   not all internal values. For example, copying an array produces a
   new array with identically-same elements as the original.

"),

("All Objects","Base","deepcopy","deepcopy(x)


   Create a deep copy of \"x\": everything is copied recursively,
   resulting in a fully independent object. For example, deep-copying
   an array produces a new array whose elements are deep-copies of the
   original elements.

   As a special case, functions can only be actually deep-copied if
   they are anonymous, otherwise they are just copied. The difference
   is only relevant in the case of closures, i.e. functions which may
   contain hidden internal references.

   While it isn't normally necessary, user-defined types can override
   the default \"deepcopy\" behavior by defining a specialized version
   of the function \"deepcopy_internal(x::T, dict::ObjectIdDict)\"
   (which shouldn't otherwise be used), where \"T\" is the type to be
   specialized for, and \"dict\" keeps track of objects copied so far
   within the recursion. Within the definition, \"deepcopy_internal\"
   should be used in place of \"deepcopy\", and the \"dict\" variable
   should be updated as appropriate before returning.

"),

("All Objects","Base","isdefined","isdefined(object, index | symbol)


   Tests whether an assignable location is defined. The arguments can
   be an array and index, a composite object and field name (as a
   symbol), or a module and a symbol.

   Try to convert \"x\" to the given type.

"),

   Convert all arguments to their common promotion type (if any), and
   return them all (as a tuple).

"),

("All Objects","Base","oftype","oftype(x, y)


   Convert \"y\" to the type of \"x\".

   Return the supertype of DataType T

"),

("Types","Base","subtype","subtype(type1, type2)


   True if and only if all values of \"type1\" are also of \"type2\".
   Can also be written using the \"<:\" infix operator as \"type1 <:
   type2\".

"),

("Types","Base","<:","<:(T1, T2)


   Subtype operator, equivalent to \"subtype(T1,T2)\".

"),

("Types","Base","subtypes","subtypes(T::DataType)


   Return a list of immediate subtypes of DataType T.  Note that all
   currently loaded subtypes are included, including those not visible
   in the current module.

"),

("Types","Base","subtypetree","subtypetree(T::DataType)


   Return a nested list of all subtypes of DataType T.  Note that all
   currently loaded subtypes are included, including those not visible

   The highest finite value representable by the given floating-point
   type

"),

("Types","Base","maxintfloat","maxintfloat(type)


   The largest integer losslessly representable by the given floating-
   point type

"),

("Types","Base","sizeof","sizeof(type)


   Size, in bytes, of the canonical binary representation of the given
   type, if any.

"),

("Types","Base","eps","eps([type])


   The distance between 1.0 and the next larger representable
   floating-point value of \"type\". The only types that are sensible
   arguments are \"Float32\" and \"Float64\". If \"type\" is omitted,
   then \"eps(Float64)\" is returned.

"),

("Types","Base","eps","eps(x)


   The distance between \"x\" and the next larger representable
   floating-point value of the same type as \"x\".

"),

("Types","Base","promote_type","promote_type(type1, type2)


   Determine a type big enough to hold values of each argument type
   without loss, whenever possible. In some cases, where no type
   exists which to which both types can be promoted losslessly, some
   loss is tolerated; for example, \"promote_type(Int64,Float64)\"
   returns \"Float64\" even though strictly, not all \"Int64\" values
   can be represented exactly as \"Float64\" values.

"),

("Types","Base","promote_rule","promote_rule(type1, type2)


   Specifies what type should be used by \"promote\" when given values
   of types \"type1\" and \"type2\". This function should not be
   called directly, but should have definitions added to it for new
   types as appropriate.

"),

("Types","Base","getfield","getfield(value, name::Symbol)


   Extract a named field from a value of composite type. The syntax
   \"a.b\" calls \"getfield(a, :b)\", and the syntax \"a.(b)\" calls
   \"getfield(a, b)\".

"),

("Types","Base","setfield","setfield(value, name::Symbol, x)


   Assign \"x\" to a named field in \"value\" of composite type. The
   syntax \"a.b = c\" calls \"setfield(a, :b, c)\", and the syntax
   \"a.(b) = c\" calls \"setfield(a, b, c)\".

"),

("Types","Base","fieldoffsets","fieldoffsets(type)


   The offset of each field of \"type\" relative to data start.

"),

("Types","Base","fieldtype","fieldtype(value, name::Symbol)


   Determine the declared type of a named field in a value of
   composite type.

   for a discussion of immutability.

"),

("Types","Base","isbits","isbits(T)

"),

("Types","Base","isleaftype","isleaftype(T)


   Determine whether \"T\" is a concrete type that can have instances,

   applicable to the given arguments.

"),

("Generic Functions","Base","invoke","invoke(f, (types...), args...)


   Invoke a method for the given generic function matching the
   specified types (as a tuple), on the specified arguments. The
   arguments must be compatible with the specified types. This allows
   invoking a method other than the most specific matching method,
   which is useful when the behavior of a more general definition is
   explicitly needed (often as part of the implementation of a more
   specific method of the same function).

"),

   Applies a function to the preceding argument which allows for easy
   function chaining.

   If \"use_mmap\" is \"true\" the file specified by \"source\" is
   memory mapped for potential speedups.

   If \"ignore_invalid_chars\" is \"true\" bytes in \"source\" with

   Create an \"Array\" whose values are linked to a file, using

   too large to fit in the computer's memory.

   The type determines how the bytes of the array are interpreted (no
   format conversions are possible), and dims is a tuple containing
   the size of the array.

   The file is specified via the stream.  When you initialize the
   stream, use \"\"r\"\" for a \"read-only\" array, and \"\"w+\"\" to
   create a new array used to write values to disk. Optionally, you
   can specify an offset (in bytes) if, for example, you want to skip
   over a header in the file.

   **Example**:  \"A = mmap_array(Int64, (25,30000), s)\"

   and must be \"Bool\" if given.

   **Example**:  \"B = mmap_bitarray((25,30000), s)\"

   The \"flags\" argument is a bitwise-or of FFTW planner flags,

   Performs a multidimensional real-input/real-output (r2r) transform

   \"kind\" specifies either a discrete cosine transform of various
   types (\"FFTW.REDFT00\", \"FFTW.REDFT01\", \"FFTW.REDFT10\", or
   \"FFTW.REDFT11\"), a discrete sine transform of various types

("Numerical Integration","Base","quadgk","quadgk(f, a, b, c...;
reltol=sqrt(eps), abstol=0, maxevals=10^7, order=7)


   Numerically integrate the function \"f(x)\" from \"a\" to \"b\",
   and optionally over additional intervals \"b\" to \"c\" and so on.
   Keyword options include a relative error tolerance \"reltol\"
   (defaults to \"sqrt(eps)\" in the precision of the endpoints), an
   absolute error tolerance \"abstol\" (defaults to 0), a maximum
   number of function evaluations \"maxevals\" (defaults to \"10^7\"),
   and the \"order\" of the integration rule (defaults to 7).

   Returns a pair \"(I,E)\" of the estimated integral \"I\" and an
   estimated upper bound on the absolute error \"E\".  If \"maxevals\"
   is not exceeded then either \"E <= abstol\" or \"E <=
   reltol*norm(I)\" will hold.  (Note that it is useful to specify a
   positive \"abstol\" in cases where \"norm(I)\" may be zero.)

   The endpoints \"a\" etcetera can also be complex (in which case the
   integral is performed over straight-line segments in the complex
   plane).  If the endpoints are \"BigFloat\", then the integration
   will be performed in \"BigFloat\" precision as well (note: it is
   advisable to increase the integration \"order\" in rough proportion
   to the precision, for smooth integrands).  More generally, the
   precision is set by the precision of the integration endpoints
   (promoted to floating-point types).

   The integrand \"f(x)\" can return any numeric scalar, vector, or
   matrix type, or in fact any type supporting \"+\", \"-\",
   multiplication by real values, and a \"norm\" (i.e., any normed
   vector space).

   The algorithm is an adaptive Gauss-Kronrod integration technique:
   the integral in each interval is estimated using a Kronrod rule
   (\"2*order+1\" points) and the error is estimated using an embedded
   Gauss rule (\"order\" points).   The interval with the largest
   error is then subdivided into two intervals and the process is
   repeated until the desired error tolerance is achieved.

   These quadrature rules work best for smooth functions within each
   interval, so if your function has a known discontinuity or other
   singularity, it is best to subdivide your interval to put the
   singularity at an endpoint.  For example, if \"f\" has a
   discontinuity at \"x=0.7\" and you want to integrate from 0 to 1,
   you should use \"quadgk(f, 0,0.7,1)\" to subdivide the interval at
   the point of discontinuity.  The integrand is never evaluated
   exactly at the endpoints of the intervals, so it is possible to
   integrate functions that diverge at the endpoints as long as the
   singularity is integrable (for example, a \"log(x)\" or
   \"1/sqrt(x)\" singularity).

   For real-valued endpoints, the starting and/or ending points may be
   infinite.  (A coordinate transformation is performed internally to
   map the infinite interval to a finite one.)

   You can specify an algorithm to use via the \"alg\" keyword (see

   lets you provide a function that will be applied to each element
   before comparison; the \"lt\" keyword allows providing a custom
   \"less than\" function; use \"rev=true\" to reverse the sorting
   order. These options are independent and can be used together in
   all possible combinations: if both \"by\" and \"lt\" are specified,
