# automatically generated from files in doc/stdlib/ -- do not edit here

Any[

("Base","exit","exit([code])

   Quit (or control-D at the prompt). The default exit code is zero,
   indicating that the processes completed successfully.

"),

("Base","quit","quit()

   Quit the program indicating that the processes completed
   successfully. This function calls \"exit(0)\" (see \"exit()\").

"),

("Base","atexit","atexit(f)

   Register a zero-argument function to be called at exit.

"),

("Base","isinteractive","isinteractive() -> Bool

   Determine whether Julia is running an interactive session.

"),

("Base","whos","whos([Module,] [pattern::Regex])

   Print information about exported global variables in a module,
   optionally restricted to those matching \"pattern\".

"),

("Base","edit","edit(file::String[, line])

   Edit a file optionally providing a line number to edit at. Returns
   to the julia prompt when you quit the editor.

"),

("Base","edit","edit(function[, types])

   Edit the definition of a function, optionally specifying a tuple of
   types to indicate which method to edit.

"),

("Base","@edit","@edit()

   Evaluates the arguments to the function call, determines their
   types, and calls the \"edit\" function on the resulting expression

"),

("Base","less","less(file::String[, line])

   Show a file using the default pager, optionally providing a
   starting line number. Returns to the julia prompt when you quit the
   pager.

"),

("Base","less","less(function[, types])

   Show the definition of a function using the default pager,
   optionally specifying a tuple of types to indicate which method to
   see.

"),

("Base","@less","@less()

   Evaluates the arguments to the function call, determines their
   types, and calls the \"less\" function on the resulting expression

"),

("Base","clipboard","clipboard(x)

   Send a printed form of \"x\" to the operating system clipboard
   (\"copy\").

"),

("Base","clipboard","clipboard() -> String

   Return a string with the contents of the operating system clipboard
   (\"paste\").

"),

("Base","require","require(file::String...)

   Load source files once, in the context of the \"Main\" module, on
   every active node, searching standard locations for files.
   \"require\" is considered a top-level operation, so it sets the
   current \"include\" path but does not use it to search for files
   (see help for \"include\"). This function is typically used to load
   library code, and is implicitly called by \"using\" to load
   packages.

   When searching for files, \"require\" first looks in the current
   working directory, then looks for package code under \"Pkg.dir()\",
   then tries paths in the global array \"LOAD_PATH\".

"),

("Base","reload","reload(file::String)

   Like \"require\", except forces loading of files regardless of
   whether they have been loaded before. Typically used when
   interactively developing libraries.

"),

("Base","include","include(path::String)

   Evaluate the contents of a source file in the current context.
   During including, a task-local include path is set to the directory
   containing the file. Nested calls to \"include\" will search
   relative to that path. All paths refer to files on node 1 when
   running in parallel, and files will be fetched from node 1. This
   function is typically used to load source interactively, or to
   combine files in packages that are broken into multiple source
   files.

"),

("Base","include_string","include_string(code::String)

   Like \"include\", except reads code from the given string rather
   than from a file. Since there is no file path involved, no path
   processing or fetching from node 1 is done.

"),

("Base","help","help(name)

   Get help for a function. \"name\" can be an object or a string.

"),

("Base","apropos","apropos(string)

   Search documentation for functions related to \"string\".

"),

("Base","which","which(f, types)

   Return the method of \"f\" (a \"Method\" object) that will be
   called for arguments with the given types.

"),

("Base","@which","@which()

   Evaluates the arguments to the function call, determines their
   types, and calls the \"which\" function on the resulting expression

"),

("Base","methods","methods(f[, types])

   Show all methods of \"f\" with their argument types.

   If \"types\" is specified, an array of methods whose types match is
   returned.

"),

("Base","methodswith","methodswith(typ[, module or function][, showparents])

   Return an array of methods with an argument of type \"typ\". If
   optional \"showparents\" is \"true\", also return arguments with a
   parent type of \"typ\", excluding type \"Any\".

   The optional second argument restricts the search to a particular
   module or function.

"),

("Base","@show","@show()

   Show an expression and result, returning the result

"),

("Base","versioninfo","versioninfo([verbose::Bool])

   Print information about the version of Julia in use. If the
   \"verbose\" argument is true, detailed system information is shown
   as well.

"),

("Base","workspace","workspace()

   Replace the top-level module (\"Main\") with a new one, providing a
   clean workspace. The previous \"Main\" module is made available as
   \"LastMain\". A previously-loaded package can be accessed using a
   statement such as \"using LastMain.Package\".

   This function should only be used interactively.

"),

("Base","is","is(x, y) -> Bool
===(x, y) -> Bool
â‰¡(x, y) -> Bool

   Determine whether \"x\" and \"y\" are identical, in the sense that
   no program could distinguish them. Compares mutable objects by
   address in memory, and compares immutable objects (such as numbers)
   by contents at the bit level. This function is sometimes called
   \"egal\".

"),

("Base","isa","isa(x, type) -> Bool

   Determine whether \"x\" is of the given \"type\".

"),

("Base","isequal","isequal(x, y)

   Similar to \"==\", except treats all floating-point \"NaN\" values
   as equal to each other, and treats \"-0.0\" as unequal to \"0.0\".
   For values that are not floating-point, \"isequal\" is the same as
   \"==\".

   \"isequal\" is the comparison function used by hash tables
   (\"Dict\"). \"isequal(x,y)\" must imply that \"hash(x) ==
   hash(y)\".

   Collections typically implement \"isequal\" by calling \"isequal\"
   recursively on all contents.

   Scalar types generally do not need to implement \"isequal\", unless
   they represent floating-point numbers amenable to a more efficient
   implementation than that provided as a generic fallback (based on
   \"isnan\", \"signbit\", and \"==\").

"),

("Base","isless","isless(x, y)

   Test whether \"x\" is less than \"y\", according to a canonical
   total order. Values that are normally unordered, such as \"NaN\",
   are ordered in an arbitrary but consistent fashion. This is the
   default comparison used by \"sort\". Non-numeric types with a
   canonical total order should implement this function. Numeric types
   only need to implement it if they have special values such as
   \"NaN\".

"),

("Base","ifelse","ifelse(condition::Bool, x, y)

   Return \"x\" if \"condition\" is true, otherwise return \"y\". This
   differs from \"?\" or \"if\" in that it is an ordinary function, so
   all the arguments are evaluated first.

"),

("Base","lexcmp","lexcmp(x, y)

   Compare \"x\" and \"y\" lexicographically and return -1, 0, or 1
   depending on whether \"x\" is less than, equal to, or greater than
   \"y\", respectively. This function should be defined for
   lexicographically comparable types, and \"lexless\" will call
   \"lexcmp\" by default.

"),

("Base","lexless","lexless(x, y)

   Determine whether \"x\" is lexicographically less than \"y\".

"),

("Base","typeof","typeof(x)

   Get the concrete type of \"x\".

"),

("Base","tuple","tuple(xs...)

   Construct a tuple of the given objects.

"),

("Base","ntuple","ntuple(n, f::Function)

   Create a tuple of length \"n\", computing each element as \"f(i)\",
   where \"i\" is the index of the element.

"),

("Base","object_id","object_id(x)

   Get a unique integer id for \"x\". \"object_id(x)==object_id(y)\"
   if and only if \"is(x,y)\".

"),

("Base","hash","hash(x[, h])

   Compute an integer hash code such that \"isequal(x,y)\" implies
   \"hash(x)==hash(y)\". The optional second argument \"h\" is a hash
   code to be mixed with the result. New types should implement the
   2-argument form.

"),

("Base","finalizer","finalizer(x, function)

   Register a function \"f(x)\" to be called when there are no
   program-accessible references to \"x\". The behavior of this
   function is unpredictable if \"x\" is of a bits type.

"),

("Base","copy","copy(x)

   Create a shallow copy of \"x\": the outer structure is copied, but
   not all internal values. For example, copying an array produces a
   new array with identically-same elements as the original.

"),

("Base","deepcopy","deepcopy(x)

   Create a deep copy of \"x\": everything is copied recursively,
   resulting in a fully independent object. For example, deep-copying
   an array produces a new array whose elements are deep copies of the
   original elements. Calling *deepcopy* on an object should generally
   have the same effect as serializing and then deserializing it.

   As a special case, functions can only be actually deep-copied if
   they are anonymous, otherwise they are just copied. The difference
   is only relevant in the case of closures, i.e. functions which may
   contain hidden internal references.

   While it isn't normally necessary, user-defined types can override
   the default \"deepcopy\" behavior by defining a specialized version
   of the function \"deepcopy_internal(x::T, dict::ObjectIdDict)\"
   (which shouldn't otherwise be used), where \"T\" is the type to be
   specialized for, and \"dict\" keeps track of objects copied so far
   within the recursion. Within the definition, \"deepcopy_internal\"
   should be used in place of \"deepcopy\", and the \"dict\" variable
   should be updated as appropriate before returning.

"),

("Base","isdefined","isdefined([object], index | symbol)

   Tests whether an assignable location is defined. The arguments can
   be an array and index, a composite object and field name (as a
   symbol), or a module and a symbol. With a single symbol argument,
   tests whether a global variable with that name is defined in
   \"current_module()\".

"),

("Base","convert","convert(type, x)

   Try to convert \"x\" to the given type. Conversion to a different
   numeric type will raise an \"InexactError\" if \"x\" cannot be
   represented exactly in the new type.

"),

("Base","promote","promote(xs...)

   Convert all arguments to their common promotion type (if any), and
   return them all (as a tuple).

"),

("Base","oftype","oftype(x, y)

   Convert \"y\" to the type of \"x\" (\"convert(typeof(x), y)\").

"),

("Base","widen","widen(type | x)

   If the argument is a type, return a \"larger\" type (for numeric
   types, this will be a type with at least as much range and
   precision as the argument, and usually more). Otherwise the
   argument \"x\" is converted to \"widen(typeof(x))\".

      julia> widen(Int32)
      Int64

      julia> widen(1.5f0)
      1.5

"),

("Base","identity","identity(x)

   The identity function. Returns its argument.

"),

("Base","super","super(T::DataType)

   Return the supertype of DataType T

"),

("Base","issubtype","issubtype(type1, type2)

   True if and only if all values of \"type1\" are also of \"type2\".
   Can also be written using the \"<:\" infix operator as \"type1 <:
   type2\".

"),

("Base","<:","<:(T1, T2)

   Subtype operator, equivalent to \"issubtype(T1,T2)\".

"),

("Base","subtypes","subtypes(T::DataType)

   Return a list of immediate subtypes of DataType T.  Note that all
   currently loaded subtypes are included, including those not visible
   in the current module.

"),

("Base","subtypetree","subtypetree(T::DataType)

   Return a nested list of all subtypes of DataType T.  Note that all
   currently loaded subtypes are included, including those not visible
   in the current module.

"),

("Base","typemin","typemin(type)

   The lowest value representable by the given (real) numeric type.

"),

("Base","typemax","typemax(type)

   The highest value representable by the given (real) numeric type.

"),

("Base","realmin","realmin(type)

   The smallest in absolute value non-subnormal value representable by
   the given floating-point type

"),

("Base","realmax","realmax(type)

   The highest finite value representable by the given floating-point
   type

"),

("Base","maxintfloat","maxintfloat(type)

   The largest integer losslessly representable by the given floating-
   point type

"),

("Base","sizeof","sizeof(type)

   Size, in bytes, of the canonical binary representation of the given
   type, if any.

"),

("Base","eps","eps([type])

   The distance between 1.0 and the next larger representable
   floating-point value of \"type\". Only floating-point types are
   sensible arguments. If \"type\" is omitted, then \"eps(Float64)\"
   is returned.

"),

("Base","eps","eps(x)

   The distance between \"x\" and the next larger representable
   floating-point value of the same type as \"x\".

"),

("Base","promote_type","promote_type(type1, type2)

   Determine a type big enough to hold values of each argument type
   without loss, whenever possible. In some cases, where no type
   exists to which both types can be promoted losslessly, some loss is
   tolerated; for example, \"promote_type(Int64,Float64)\" returns
   \"Float64\" even though strictly, not all \"Int64\" values can be
   represented exactly as \"Float64\" values.

"),

("Base","promote_rule","promote_rule(type1, type2)

   Specifies what type should be used by \"promote\" when given values
   of types \"type1\" and \"type2\". This function should not be
   called directly, but should have definitions added to it for new
   types as appropriate.

"),

("Base","getfield","getfield(value, name::Symbol)

   Extract a named field from a value of composite type. The syntax
   \"a.b\" calls \"getfield(a, :b)\", and the syntax \"a.(b)\" calls
   \"getfield(a, b)\".

"),

("Base","setfield!","setfield!(value, name::Symbol, x)

   Assign \"x\" to a named field in \"value\" of composite type. The
   syntax \"a.b = c\" calls \"setfield!(a, :b, c)\", and the syntax
   \"a.(b) = c\" calls \"setfield!(a, b, c)\".

"),

("Base","fieldoffsets","fieldoffsets(type)

   The byte offset of each field of a type relative to the data start.
   For example, we could use it in the following manner to summarize
   information about a struct type:

      julia> structinfo(T) = [zip(fieldoffsets(T),names(T),T.types)...];

      julia> structinfo(StatStruct)
      12-element Array{(Int64,Symbol,DataType),1}:
       (0,:device,Uint64)
       (8,:inode,Uint64)
       (16,:mode,Uint64)
       (24,:nlink,Int64)
       (32,:uid,Uint64)
       (40,:gid,Uint64)
       (48,:rdev,Uint64)
       (56,:size,Int64)
       (64,:blksize,Int64)
       (72,:blocks,Int64)
       (80,:mtime,Float64)
       (88,:ctime,Float64)

"),

("Base","fieldtype","fieldtype(value, name::Symbol)

   Determine the declared type of a named field in a value of
   composite type.

"),

("Base","isimmutable","isimmutable(v)

   True if value \"v\" is immutable.  See *Immutable Composite Types*
   for a discussion of immutability.

"),

("Base","isbits","isbits(T)

   True if \"T\" is a \"plain data\" type, meaning it is immutable and
   contains no references to other values. Typical examples are
   numeric types such as \"Uint8\", \"Float64\", and
   \"Complex{Float64}\".

      julia> isbits(Complex{Float64})
      true

      julia> isbits(Complex)
      false

"),

("Base","isleaftype","isleaftype(T)

   Determine whether \"T\" is a concrete type that can have instances,
   meaning its only subtypes are itself and \"None\" (but \"T\" itself
   is not \"None\").

"),

("Base","typejoin","typejoin(T, S)

   Compute a type that contains both \"T\" and \"S\".

"),

("Base","typeintersect","typeintersect(T, S)

   Compute a type that contains the intersection of \"T\" and \"S\".
   Usually this will be the smallest such type or one close to it.

"),

("Base","apply","apply(f, x...)

   Accepts a function and several arguments, each of which must be
   iterable. The elements generated by all the arguments are appended
   into a single list, which is then passed to \"f\" as its argument
   list.

      julia> function f(x, y) # Define a function f
                 x + y
             end;

      julia> apply(f, [1 2]) # Apply f with 1 and 2 as arguments
      3

   \"apply\" is called to implement the \"...\" argument splicing
   syntax, and is usually not called directly: \"apply(f,x) ===
   f(x...)\"

"),

("Base","method_exists","method_exists(f, tuple) -> Bool

   Determine whether the given generic function has a method matching
   the given tuple of argument types.

      julia> method_exists(length, (Array,))
      true

"),

("Base","applicable","applicable(f, args...) -> Bool

   Determine whether the given generic function has a method
   applicable to the given arguments.

      julia> function f(x, y)
                 x + y
             end;

      julia> applicable(f, 1)
      false

      julia> applicable(f, 1, 2)
      true

"),

("Base","invoke","invoke(f, (types...), args...)

   Invoke a method for the given generic function matching the
   specified types (as a tuple), on the specified arguments. The
   arguments must be compatible with the specified types. This allows
   invoking a method other than the most specific matching method,
   which is useful when the behavior of a more general definition is
   explicitly needed (often as part of the implementation of a more
   specific method of the same function).

"),

("Base","|>","|>(x, f)

   Applies a function to the preceding argument. This allows for easy
   function chaining.

      julia> [1:5] |> x->x.^2 |> sum |> inv
      0.01818181818181818

"),

("Base","eval","eval([m::Module], expr::Expr)

   Evaluate an expression in the given module and return the result.
   Every module (except those defined with \"baremodule\") has its own
   1-argument definition of \"eval\", which evaluates expressions in
   that module.

"),

("Base","@eval","@eval()

   Evaluate an expression and return the value.

"),

("Base","evalfile","evalfile(path::String)

   Evaluate all expressions in the given file, and return the value of
   the last one. No other processing (path searching, fetching from
   node 1, etc.) is performed.

"),

("Base","esc","esc(e::ANY)

   Only valid in the context of an Expr returned from a macro.
   Prevents the macro hygiene pass from turning embedded variables
   into gensym variables. See the *Macros* section of the
   Metaprogramming chapter of the manual for more details and
   examples.

"),

("Base","gensym","gensym([tag])

   Generates a symbol which will not conflict with other variable
   names.

"),

("Base","@gensym","@gensym()

   Generates a gensym symbol for a variable. For example, \"@gensym x
   y\" is transformed into \"x = gensym(\"x\"); y = gensym(\"y\")\".

"),

("Base","parse","parse(str, start; greedy=true, raise=true)

   Parse the expression string and return an expression (which could
   later be passed to eval for execution). Start is the index of the
   first character to start parsing. If \"greedy\" is true (default),
   \"parse\" will try to consume as much input as it can; otherwise,
   it will stop as soon as it has parsed a valid expression. If
   \"raise\" is true (default), syntax errors will raise an error;
   otherwise, \"parse\" will return an expression that will raise an
   error upon evaluation.

"),

("Base","parse","parse(str; raise=true)

   Parse the whole string greedily, returning a single expression.  An
   error is thrown if there are additional characters after the first
   expression. If \"raise\" is true (default), syntax errors will
   raise an error; otherwise, \"parse\" will return an expression that
   will raise an error upon evaluation.

"),

("Base","start","start(iter) -> state

   Get initial iteration state for an iterable object

"),

("Base","done","done(iter, state) -> Bool

   Test whether we are done iterating

"),

("Base","next","next(iter, state) -> item, state

   For a given iterable object and iteration state, return the current
   item and the next iteration state

"),

("Base","zip","zip(iters...)

   For a set of iterable objects, returns an iterable of tuples, where
   the \"i\"th tuple contains the \"i\"th component of each input
   iterable.

   Note that \"zip\" is its own inverse: \"[zip(zip(a...)...)...] ==
   [a...]\".

"),

("Base","enumerate","enumerate(iter)

   Return an iterator that yields \"(i, x)\" where \"i\" is an index
   starting at 1, and \"x\" is the \"i\"th value from the given
   iterator. It's useful when you need not only the values \"x\" over
   which you are iterating, but also the index \"i\" of the
   iterations.

      julia> a = [\"a\", \"b\", \"c\"];

      julia> for (index, value) in enumerate(a)
                 println(\"\$index \$value\")

      1 a
      2 b

"),

("Base","isempty","isempty(collection) -> Bool

   Determine whether a collection is empty (has no elements).

      julia> isempty([])
      true

      julia> isempty([1 2 3])
      false

"),

("Base","empty!","empty!(collection) -> collection

   Remove all elements from a \"collection\".

"),

("Base","length","length(collection) -> Integer

   For ordered, indexable collections, the maximum index \"i\" for
   which \"getindex(collection, i)\" is valid. For unordered
   collections, the number of elements.

"),

("Base","endof","endof(collection) -> Integer

   Returns the last index of the collection.

      julia> endof([1,2,4])
      3

"),

("Base","in","in(item, collection) -> Bool
âˆˆ(item, collection) -> Bool
âˆ‹(collection, item) -> Bool
âˆ‰(item, collection) -> Bool
âˆŒ(collection, item) -> Bool

   Determine whether an item is in the given collection, in the sense
   that it is \"==\" to one of the values generated by iterating over
   the collection. Some collections need a slightly different
   definition; for example Sets check whether the item is \"isequal\"
   to one of the elements. Dicts look for \"(key,value)\" pairs, and
   the key is compared using \"isequal\". To test for the presence of
   a key in a dictionary, use \"haskey\" or \"k in keys(dict)\".

"),

("Base","eltype","eltype(collection)

   Determine the type of the elements generated by iterating
   \"collection\". For associative collections, this will be a
   \"(key,value)\" tuple type.

"),

("Base","indexin","indexin(a, b)

   Returns a vector containing the highest index in \"b\" for each
   value in \"a\" that is a member of \"b\" . The output vector
   contains 0 wherever \"a\" is not a member of \"b\".

"),

("Base","findin","findin(a, b)

   Returns the indices of elements in collection \"a\" that appear in
   collection \"b\"

"),

("Base","unique","unique(itr[, dim])

   Returns an array containing only the unique elements of the
   iterable \"itr\", in the order that the first of each set of
   equivalent elements originally appears. If \"dim\" is specified,
   returns unique regions of the array \"itr\" along \"dim\".

"),

("Base","reduce","reduce(op, v0, itr)

   Reduce the given collection \"Ã¬tr\" with the given binary operator.
   Reductions for certain commonly-used operators have special
   implementations which should be used instead: \"maximum(itr)\",
   \"minimum(itr)\", \"sum(itr)\", \"prod(itr)\", \"any(itr)\",
   \"all(itr)\".

   The associativity of the reduction is implementation-dependent.
   This means that you can't use non-associative operations like \"-\"
   because it is undefined whether \"reduce(-,[1,2,3])\" should be
   evaluated as \"(1-2)-3\" or \"1-(2-3)\". Use \"foldl\" or \"foldr\"
   instead for guaranteed left or right associativity.

   Some operations accumulate error, and parallelism will also be
   easier if the reduction can be executed in groups. Future versions
   of Julia might change the algorithm. Note that the elements are not
   reordered if you use an ordered collection.

"),

("Base","reduce","reduce(op, itr)

   Like \"reduce\" but using the first element as v0.

"),

("Base","foldl","foldl(op, v0, itr)

   Compute the maximum value of \"A\" over the singleton dimensions of
   \"r\", and write results to \"r\".

"),

("Base","minimum","minimum(itr)

   Returns the smallest element in a collection.

"),

("Base","minimum","minimum(A, dims)

   Compute the minimum value of an array over the given dimensions.

"),

("Base","minimum!","minimum!(r, A)

   Compute the minimum value of \"A\" over the singleton dimensions of
   \"r\", and write results to \"r\".

("Base","poll_fd","poll_fd(fd, seconds::Real; readable=false, writable=false)

   Poll a file descriptor fd for changes in the read or write
   availability and with a timeout given by the second argument. If
   the timeout is not needed, use \"wait(fd)\" instead. The keyword
   arguments determine which of read and/or write status should be
   monitored and at least one of them needs to be set to true. The
   returned value is an object with boolean fields \"readable\",
   \"writable\", and \"timedout\", giving the result of the polling.

"),

("Base","poll_file","poll_file(s, interval_seconds::Real, seconds::Real)

   Monitor a file for changes by polling every *interval_seconds*
   seconds for *seconds* seconds. A return value of true indicates the
   file changed, a return value of false indicates a timeout.

"),

("Base","show","show(x)

   Write an informative text representation of a value to the current
   output stream. New types should overload \"show(io, x)\" where the
   first argument is a stream. The representation used by \"show\"
   generally includes Julia-specific formatting and type information.

"),

("Base","showcompact","showcompact(x)

   Show a more compact representation of a value. This is used for
   printing array elements. If a new type has a different compact
   representation, it should overload \"showcompact(io, x)\" where the
   first argument is a stream.

"),

("Base","showall","showall(x)

   Similar to \"show\", except shows all elements of arrays.

"),

("Base","summary","summary(x)

   Return a string giving a brief description of a value. By default
   returns \"string(typeof(x))\". For arrays, returns strings like
   \"2x2 Float64 Array\".

"),

("Base","print","print(x)

   Write (to the default output stream) a canonical (un-decorated)
   text representation of a value if there is one, otherwise call
   \"show\". The representation used by \"print\" includes minimal
   formatting and tries to avoid Julia-specific details.

"),

("Base","println","println(x)

   Print (using \"print()\") \"x\" followed by a newline.

"),

("Base","print_with_color","print_with_color(color::Symbol[, io], strings...)

   Print strings in a color specified as a symbol, for example
   \":red\" or \":blue\".

   Print arg(s) using C \"printf()\" style format specification
   string. Optionally, an IOStream may be passed as the first argument
   to redirect output.

"),

("Base","@sprintf","@sprintf(\"%Fmt\", args...)

   Return \"@printf\" formatted output as string.

"),

("Base","sprint","sprint(f::Function, args...)

   Call the given function with an I/O stream and the supplied extra
   arguments. Everything written to this I/O stream is returned as a
   string.

"),

("Base","showerror","showerror(io, e)

   Show a descriptive representation of an exception object.

"),

("Base","dump","dump(x)

   Show all user-visible structure of a value.

"),

("Base","xdump","xdump(x)

   Show all structure of a value, including all fields of objects.

"),

("Base","readall","readall(stream::IO)

   Read the entire contents of an I/O stream as a string.

"),

("Base","readall","readall(filename::String)

   Open \"filename\", read the entire contents as a string, then close
   the file. Equivalent to \"open(readall, filename)\".

"),

("Base","readline","readline(stream=STDIN)

   Read a single line of text, including a trailing newline character
   (if one is reached before the end of the input), from the given
   \"stream\" (defaults to \"STDIN\"),

"),

("Base","readuntil","readuntil(stream, delim)

   Read a string, up to and including the given delimiter byte.

"),

("Base","readlines","readlines(stream)

   Read all lines as an array.

"),

("Base","eachline","eachline(stream)

   Create an iterable object that will yield each line from a stream.

"),

("Base","readdlm","readdlm(source, delim::Char, T::Type, eol::Char; header=false, skipstart=0, skipblanks=true, use_mmap, ignore_invalid_chars=false, quotes=true, dims, comments=true, comment_char='#')

   Read a matrix from the source where each line (separated by
   \"eol\") gives one row, with elements separated by the given
   delimeter. The source can be a text file, stream or byte array.
   Memory mapped files can be used by passing the byte array
   representation of the mapped segment as source.

   If \"T\" is a numeric type, the result is an array of that type,
   with any non-numeric elements as \"NaN\" for floating-point types,
   or zero. Other useful values of \"T\" include \"ASCIIString\",
   \"String\", and \"Any\".

   If \"header\" is \"true\", the first row of data will be read as
   header and the tuple \"(data_cells, header_cells)\" is returned
   instead of only \"data_cells\".

   Specifying \"skipstart\" will ignore the corresponding number of
   initial lines from the input.

   If \"skipblanks\" is \"true\", blank lines in the input will be
   ignored.

   If \"use_mmap\" is \"true\", the file specified by \"source\" is
   memory mapped for potential speedups. Default is \"true\" except on
   Windows. On Windows, you may want to specify \"true\" if the file
   is large, and is only read once and not written to.

   If \"ignore_invalid_chars\" is \"true\", bytes in \"source\" with
   invalid character encoding will be ignored. Otherwise an error is
   thrown indicating the offending character position.

   If \"quotes\" is \"true\", column enclosed within double-quote (``)
   characters are allowed to contain new lines and column delimiters.
   Double-quote characters within a quoted field must be escaped with
   another double-quote.

   Specifying \"dims\" as a tuple of the expected rows and columns
   (including header, if any) may speed up reading of large files.

   If \"comments\" is \"true\", lines beginning with \"comment_char\"
   and text following \"comment_char\" in any line are ignored.

"),

("Base","readdlm","readdlm(source, delim::Char, eol::Char; options...)

   If all data is numeric, the result will be a numeric array. If some
   elements cannot be parsed as numbers, a cell array of numbers and
   strings is returned.

"),

("Base","readdlm","readdlm(source, delim::Char, T::Type; options...)

   The end of line delimiter is taken as \"\\n\".

"),

("Base","readdlm","readdlm(source, delim::Char; options...)

   The end of line delimiter is taken as \"\\n\". If all data is
   numeric, the result will be a numeric array. If some elements
   cannot be parsed as numbers, a cell array of numbers and strings is
   returned.

"),

("Base","readdlm","readdlm(source, T::Type; options...)

   The columns are assumed to be separated by one or more whitespaces.
   The end of line delimiter is taken as \"\\n\".

"),

("Base","readdlm","readdlm(source; options...)

   The columns are assumed to be separated by one or more whitespaces.
   The end of line delimiter is taken as \"\\n\". If all data is
   numeric, the result will be a numeric array. If some elements
   cannot be parsed as numbers, a cell array of numbers and strings is
   returned.

"),

("Base","writedlm","writedlm(f, A, delim='t')

   Write \"A\" (either an array type or an iterable collection of
   iterable rows) as text to \"f\" (either a filename string or an
   \"IO\" stream) using the given delimeter \"delim\" (which defaults
   to tab, but can be any printable Julia object, typically a \"Char\"
   or \"String\").

   For example, two vectors \"x\" and \"y\" of the same length can be
   written as two columns of tab-delimited text to \"f\" by either
   \"writedlm(f, [x y])\" or by \"writedlm(f, zip(x, y))\".

"),

("Base","readcsv","readcsv(source, [T::Type]; options...)

   Equivalent to \"readdlm\" with \"delim\" set to comma.

"),

("Base","writecsv","writecsv(filename, A)

   Equivalent to \"writedlm\" with \"delim\" set to comma.

"),

("Base","Base64Pipe","Base64Pipe(ostream)

   Returns a new write-only I/O stream, which converts any bytes
   written to it into base64-encoded ASCII bytes written to
   \"ostream\".  Calling \"close\" on the \"Base64Pipe\" stream is
   necessary to complete the encoding (but does not close
   \"ostream\").

"),

("Base","base64","base64(writefunc, args...)
base64(args...)

   Given a \"write\"-like function \"writefunc\", which takes an I/O
   stream as its first argument, \"base64(writefunc, args...)\" calls
   \"writefunc\" to write \"args...\" to a base64-encoded string, and
   returns the string.  \"base64(args...)\" is equivalent to
   \"base64(write, args...)\": it converts its arguments into bytes
   using the standard \"write\" functions and returns the
   base64-encoded string.

"),

("Base","display","display(x)
display(d::Display, x)
display(mime, x)
display(d::Display, mime, x)

   Display \"x\" using the topmost applicable display in the display
   stack, typically using the richest supported multimedia output for
   \"x\", with plain-text \"STDOUT\" output as a fallback.  The
   \"display(d, x)\" variant attempts to display \"x\" on the given
   display \"d\" only, throwing a \"MethodError\" if \"d\" cannot
   display objects of this type.

   There are also two variants with a \"mime\" argument (a MIME type
   string, such as \"\"image/png\"\"), which attempt to display \"x\"
   using the requested MIME type *only*, throwing a \"MethodError\" if
   this type is not supported by either the display(s) or by \"x\".
   With these variants, one can also supply the \"raw\" data in the
   requested MIME type by passing \"x::String\" (for MIME types with
   text-based storage, such as text/html or application/postscript) or
   \"x::Vector{Uint8}\" (for binary MIME types).

"),

("Base","redisplay","redisplay(x)
redisplay(d::Display, x)
redisplay(mime, x)
redisplay(d::Display, mime, x)

   By default, the \"redisplay\" functions simply call \"display\".
   However, some display backends may override \"redisplay\" to modify
   an existing display of \"x\" (if any).   Using \"redisplay\" is
   also a hint to the backend that \"x\" may be redisplayed several
   times, and the backend may choose to defer the display until (for
   example) the next interactive prompt.

"),

("Base","displayable","displayable(mime) -> Bool
displayable(d::Display, mime) -> Bool

   Returns a boolean value indicating whether the given \"mime\" type
   (string) is displayable by any of the displays in the current
   display stack, or specifically by the display \"d\" in the second
   variant.

"),

("Base","writemime","writemime(stream, mime, x)

   The \"display\" functions ultimately call \"writemime\" in order to
   write an object \"x\" as a given \"mime\" type to a given I/O
   \"stream\" (usually a memory buffer), if possible.  In order to
   provide a rich multimedia representation of a user-defined type
   \"T\", it is only necessary to define a new \"writemime\" method
   for \"T\", via: \"writemime(stream, ::MIME\"mime\", x::T) = ...\",
   where \"mime\" is a MIME-type string and the function body calls
   \"write\" (or similar) to write that representation of \"x\" to
   \"stream\". (Note that the \"MIME\"\"\" notation only supports
   literal strings; to construct \"MIME\" types in a more flexible
   manner use \"MIME{symbol(\"\")}\".)

   For example, if you define a \"MyImage\" type and know how to write
   it to a PNG file, you could define a function \"writemime(stream,
   ::MIME\"image/png\", x::MyImage) = ...`\" to allow your images to
   be displayed on any PNG-capable \"Display\" (such as IJulia). As
   usual, be sure to \"import Base.writemime\" in order to add new
   methods to the built-in Julia function \"writemime\".

   Technically, the \"MIME\"mime\"\" macro defines a singleton type
   for the given \"mime\" string, which allows us to exploit Julia's
   dispatch mechanisms in determining how to display objects of any
   given type.

"),

("Base","mimewritable","mimewritable(mime, x)

   Returns a boolean value indicating whether or not the object \"x\"
   can be written as the given \"mime\" type.  (By default, this is
   determined automatically by the existence of the corresponding
   \"writemime\" function for \"typeof(x)\".)

"),

("Base","reprmime","reprmime(mime, x)

   Returns a \"String\" or \"Vector{Uint8}\" containing the
   representation of \"x\" in the requested \"mime\" type, as written
   by \"writemime\" (throwing a \"MethodError\" if no appropriate
   \"writemime\" is available).  A \"String\" is returned for MIME
   types with textual representations (such as \"\"text/html\"\" or
   \"\"application/postscript\"\"), whereas binary data is returned as
   \"Vector{Uint8}\".  (The function \"istext(mime)\" returns whether
   or not Julia treats a given \"mime\" type as text.)

   As a special case, if \"x\" is a \"String\" (for textual MIME
   types) or a \"Vector{Uint8}\" (for binary MIME types), the
   \"reprmime\" function assumes that \"x\" is already in the
   requested \"mime\" format and simply returns \"x\".

"),

("Base","stringmime","stringmime(mime, x)

   Returns a \"String\" containing the representation of \"x\" in the
   requested \"mime\" type.  This is similar to \"reprmime\" except
   that binary data is base64-encoded as an ASCII string.

"),

("Base","pushdisplay","pushdisplay(d::Display)

   Pushes a new display \"d\" on top of the global display-backend
   stack.  Calling \"display(x)\" or \"display(mime, x)\" will display
   \"x\" on the topmost compatible backend in the stack (i.e., the
   topmost backend that does not throw a \"MethodError\").

"),

("Base","popdisplay","popdisplay()
popdisplay(d::Display)

   Pop the topmost backend off of the display-backend stack, or the
   topmost copy of \"d\" in the second variant.

"),

("Base","TextDisplay","TextDisplay(stream)

   Returns a \"TextDisplay <: Display\", which can display any object
   as the text/plain MIME type (only), writing the text representation
   to the given I/O stream.  (The text representation is the same as
   the way an object is printed in the Julia REPL.)

"),

("Base","istext","istext(m::MIME)

   Determine whether a MIME type is text data.

"),

("Base","mmap_array","mmap_array(type, dims, stream[, offset])

   Create an \"Array\" whose values are linked to a file, using
   memory-mapping. This provides a convenient way of working with data
   too large to fit in the computer's memory.

   The type determines how the bytes of the array are interpreted.
   Note that the file must be stored in binary format, and no format
   conversions are possible (this is a limitation of operating
   systems, not Julia).

   \"dims\" is a tuple specifying the size of the array.

   The file is passed via the stream argument.  When you initialize
   the stream, use \"\"r\"\" for a \"read-only\" array, and \"\"w+\"\"
   to create a new array used to write values to disk.

   Optionally, you can specify an offset (in bytes) if, for example,
   you want to skip over a header in the file. The default value for
   the offset is the current stream position.

   For example, the following code:

      # Create a file for mmapping
      # (you could alternatively use mmap_array to do this step, too)
      A = rand(1:20, 5, 30)
      s = open(\"/tmp/mmap.bin\", \"w+\")
      # We'll write the dimensions of the array as the first two Ints in the file
      write(s, size(A,1))
      write(s, size(A,2))
      # Now write the data
      write(s, A)
      close(s)

      # Test by reading it back in
      s = open(\"/tmp/mmap.bin\")   # default is read-only
      m = read(s, Int)
      n = read(s, Int)
      A2 = mmap_array(Int, (m,n), s)

   creates a \"m\"-by-\"n\" \"Matrix{Int}\", linked to the file
   associated with stream \"s\".

   A more portable file would need to encode the word size---32 bit or
   64 bit---and endianness information in the header. In practice,
   consider encoding binary data using standard formats like HDF5
   (which can be used with memory-mapping).

"),

("Base","mmap_bitarray","mmap_bitarray([type], dims, stream[, offset])

   Create a \"BitArray\" whose values are linked to a file, using
   memory-mapping; it has the same purpose, works in the same way, and
   has the same arguments, as \"mmap_array()\", but the byte
   representation is different. The \"type\" parameter is optional,
   and must be \"Bool\" if given.

   **Example**:  \"B = mmap_bitarray((25,30000), s)\"

   This would create a 25-by-30000 \"BitArray\", linked to the file
   associated with stream \"s\".

   combination of \"MS_ASYNC\", \"MS_SYNC\", or \"MS_INVALIDATE\". See
   your platform man page for specifics. The flags argument is not
   valid on Windows.

   You may not need to call \"msync\", because synchronization is
   performed at intervals automatically by the operating system.
   However, you can call this directly if, for example, you are
   concerned about losing the result of a long-running calculation.

   Generic equality operator, giving a single \"Bool\" result. Falls

   Follows IEEE semantics for floating-point numbers.

   Compute the Pearson covariance between the vector(s) in \"v1\" and
   \"v2\". Here, \"v1\" and \"v2\" can be either vectors or matrices.

   This function accepts three keyword arguments:

   * \"vardim\": the dimension of variables. When \"vardim = 1\",
     variables are considered in columns while observations in rows;
     when \"vardim = 2\", variables are in rows while observations in
     columns. By default, it is set to \"1\".

   * \"corrected\": whether to apply Bessel's correction (divide by
     \"n-1\" instead of \"n\"). By default, it is set to \"true\".

   * \"mean\": allow users to supply mean values that are known. By
     default, it is set to \"nothing\", which indicates that the
     mean(s) are unknown, and the function will compute the mean.
     Users can use \"mean=0\" to indicate that the input data are
     centered, and hence there's no need to subtract the mean.

   The size of the result depends on the size of \"v1\" and \"v2\".
   When both \"v1\" and \"v2\" are vectors, it returns the covariance
   between them as a scalar. When either one is a matrix, it returns a
   covariance matrix of size \"(n1, n2)\", where \"n1\" and \"n2\" are
   the numbers of slices in \"v1\" and \"v2\", which depend on the
   setting of \"vardim\".

   Compute the Pearson correlation between the vector(s) in \"v1\" and

   variable dimension, and \"mean\" to supply pre-computed mean
   values.

"),

("Base","fft","fft(A[, dims])

   Performs a multidimensional FFT of the array \"A\".  The optional
   \"dims\" argument specifies an iterable subset of dimensions (e.g.
   an integer, range, tuple, or array) to transform along.  Most
   efficient if the size of \"A\" along the transformed dimensions is
   a product of small primes; see \"nextprod()\".  See also
   \"plan_fft()\" for even greater efficiency.

   scaling step, which in some applications can be combined with other

   function \"plan(A)\" that computes \"fft(A, dims)\" quickly.

   The \"flags\" argument is a bitwise-or of FFTW planner flags,
   defaulting to \"FFTW.ESTIMATE\".  e.g. passing \"FFTW.MEASURE\" or
   \"FFTW.PATIENT\" will instead spend several seconds (or more)
   benchmarking different possible FFT algorithms and picking the
   fastest one; see the FFTW manual for more information on planner
   flags.  The optional \"timelimit\" argument specifies a rough upper
   bound on the allowed planning time, in seconds. Passing
   \"FFTW.MEASURE\" or \"FFTW.PATIENT\" may cause the input array
   \"A\" to be overwritten with zeros during plan creation.

   \"plan_fft!()\" is the same as \"plan_fft()\" but creates a plan
   that operates in-place on its argument (which must be an array of

   \"(floor(n_1/2)+1, ..., n_d)\".

   The optional \"dims\" argument specifies an iterable subset of one
   or more dimensions of \"A\" to transform, similar to \"fft()\".

   types (\"FFTW.REDFT00\", \"FFTW.REDFT01\", \"FFTW.REDFT10\", or
   \"FFTW.REDFT11\"), a discrete sine transform of various types
   (\"FFTW.RODFT00\", \"FFTW.RODFT01\", \"FFTW.RODFT10\", or
   \"FFTW.RODFT11\"), a real-input DFT with halfcomplex-format output
   (\"FFTW.R2HC\" and its inverse \"FFTW.HC2R\"), or a discrete
   Hartley transform (\"FFTW.DHT\").  The \"kind\" argument may be an
   array or tuple in order to specify different transform types along
   the different dimensions of \"A\"; \"kind[end]\" is used for any
   unspecified dimensions.  See the FFTW manual for precise
   definitions of these transform types, at http://www.fftw.org/doc.

   The optional \"dims\" argument specifies an iterable subset of
   dimensions (e.g. an integer, range, tuple, or array) to transform
   along. \"kind[i]\" is then the transform type for \"dims[i]\", with
   \"kind[end]\" being used for \"i > length(kind)\".

   See also \"plan_r2r()\" to pre-plan optimized r2r transforms.

"),

("Base.FFTW","r2r!","r2r!(A, kind[, dims])

   Same as \"r2r()\", but operates in-place on \"A\", which must be an
   array of real or complex floating-point numbers.

"),

("Base.FFTW","plan_r2r","plan_r2r(A, kind[, dims[, flags[, timelimit]]])

   Pre-plan an optimized r2r transform, similar to \"Base.plan_fft()\"
   except that the transforms (and the first three arguments)
   correspond to \"r2r()\" and \"r2r!()\", respectively.

"),

("Base.FFTW","plan_r2r!","plan_r2r!(A, kind[, dims[, flags[, timelimit]]])

   Similar to \"Base.plan_fft()\", but corresponds to \"r2r!()\".

"),

("Base","quadgk","quadgk(f, a, b, c...; reltol=sqrt(eps), abstol=0, maxevals=10^7, order=7, norm=vecnorm)

   Numerically integrate the function \"f(x)\" from \"a\" to \"b\",
   and optionally over additional intervals \"b\" to \"c\" and so on.
   Keyword options include a relative error tolerance \"reltol\"
   (defaults to \"sqrt(eps)\" in the precision of the endpoints), an
   absolute error tolerance \"abstol\" (defaults to 0), a maximum
   number of function evaluations \"maxevals\" (defaults to \"10^7\"),
   and the \"order\" of the integration rule (defaults to 7).

   Returns a pair \"(I,E)\" of the estimated integral \"I\" and an
   estimated upper bound on the absolute error \"E\".  If \"maxevals\"
   is not exceeded then \"E <= max(abstol, reltol*norm(I))\" will
   hold. (Note that it is useful to specify a positive \"abstol\" in
   cases where \"norm(I)\" may be zero.)

   The endpoints \"a\" etcetera can also be complex (in which case the
   integral is performed over straight-line segments in the complex
   plane).  If the endpoints are \"BigFloat\", then the integration
   will be performed in \"BigFloat\" precision as well (note: it is
   advisable to increase the integration \"order\" in rough proportion
   to the precision, for smooth integrands).  More generally, the
   precision is set by the precision of the integration endpoints
   (promoted to floating-point types).

   The integrand \"f(x)\" can return any numeric scalar, vector, or
   matrix type, or in fact any type supporting \"+\", \"-\",
   multiplication by real values, and a \"norm\" (i.e., any normed
   vector space). Alternatively, a different norm can be specified by
   passing a *norm*-like function as the *norm* keyword argument
   (which defaults to *vecnorm*).

   The algorithm is an adaptive Gauss-Kronrod integration technique:
   the integral in each interval is estimated using a Kronrod rule
   (\"2*order+1\" points) and the error is estimated using an embedded
   Gauss rule (\"order\" points).   The interval with the largest
   error is then subdivided into two intervals and the process is
   repeated until the desired error tolerance is achieved.

   These quadrature rules work best for smooth functions within each
   interval, so if your function has a known discontinuity or other
   singularity, it is best to subdivide your interval to put the
   singularity at an endpoint.  For example, if \"f\" has a
   discontinuity at \"x=0.7\" and you want to integrate from 0 to 1,
   you should use \"quadgk(f, 0,0.7,1)\" to subdivide the interval at
   the point of discontinuity.  The integrand is never evaluated
   exactly at the endpoints of the intervals, so it is possible to
   integrate functions that diverge at the endpoints as long as the
   singularity is integrable (for example, a \"log(x)\" or
   \"1/sqrt(x)\" singularity).

   For real-valued endpoints, the starting and/or ending points may be
   infinite.  (A coordinate transformation is performed internally to
   map the infinite interval to a finite one.)

("Base","addprocs","addprocs(n; manager::ClusterManager=LocalManager()) -> List of process identifiers

   \"addprocs(4)\" will add 4 processes on the local machine. This can
   be used to take advantage of multiple cores.

   Keyword argument \"manager\" can be used to provide a custom
   cluster manager to start workers. For example Beowulf clusters are
   supported via a custom cluster manager implemented in  package
   \"ClusterManagers\".

   See the documentation for package \"ClusterManagers\" for more
   information on how to write a custom cluster manager.

"),

("Base","addprocs","addprocs(machines; tunnel=false, dir=JULIA_HOME, sshflags::Cmd=``) -> List of process identifiers

   Add processes on remote machines via SSH. Requires julia to be
   installed in the same location on each node, or to be available via
   a shared file system.

   \"machines\" is a vector of host definitions of the form
   \"[user@]host[:port] [bind_addr[:port]]\". \"user\" defaults to
   current user, \"port\" to the standard ssh port. A worker is
   started at each host definition. If the optional
   \"[bind_addr[:port]]\" is specified, other workers will connect to
   this worker at the specified \"bind_addr\" and \"port\".

   Keyword arguments:

   \"tunnel\" : if \"true\" then SSH tunneling will be used to connect
   to the worker.

   \"dir\" :  specifies the location of the julia binaries on the
   worker nodes.

   \"sshflags\" : specifies additional ssh options, e.g.
   \"sshflags=`-i /home/foo/bar.pem`\" .

   \"max_parallel\" : specifies the maximum number of workers being
   launched in parallel at a host. Defaults to 10.

   Get the id of the current process.

"),

("Base","pmap","pmap(f, lsts...; err_retry=true, err_stop=false)

   Transform collections \"lsts\" by applying \"f\" to each element in
   parallel. If \"nprocs() > 1\", the calling process will be
   dedicated to assigning tasks. All other available processes will be
   used as parallel workers.

   If \"err_retry\" is true, it retries a failed application of \"f\"
   on a different worker. If \"err_stop\" is true, it takes precedence
   over the value of \"err_retry\" and \"pmap\" stops execution on the
   first error.

("Base","remotecall","remotecall(id, func, args...)

   Call a function asynchronously on the given arguments on the
   specified process. Returns a \"RemoteRef\".

"),

("Base","wait","wait([x])

   Block the current task until some event occurs, depending on the
   type of the argument:

   * \"RemoteRef\": Wait for a value to become available for the
     specified remote reference.

   * \"Condition\": Wait for \"notify\" on a condition.

   * \"Process\": Wait for a process or process chain to exit. The

     value.

   * \"RawFD\": Wait for changes on a file descriptor (see *poll_fd*
     for keyword arguments and return code)

   If no argument is passed, the task blocks for an undefined period.
   If the task's state is set to \":waiting\", it can only be
   restarted by an explicit call to \"schedule\" or \"yieldto\". If
   the task's state is \":runnable\", it might be restarted
   unpredictably.

   Often \"wait\" is called within a \"while\" loop to ensure a
   waited-for condition is met before proceeding.

   the value is removed with \"take!\". Returns its first argument.

"),

("Base","take!","take!(RemoteRef)

   Fetch the value of a remote reference, removing it so that the
   reference is empty again.

"),

("Base","isready","isready(r::RemoteRef)

   Determine whether a \"RemoteRef\" has a value stored to it. Note
   that this function can cause race conditions, since by the time you
   receive its result it may no longer be true. It is recommended that
   this function only be used on a \"RemoteRef\" that is assigned
   once.

   If the argument \"RemoteRef\" is owned by a different node, this
   call will block to wait for the answer. It is recommended to wait
   for \"r\" in a separate task instead, or to use a local
   \"RemoteRef\" as a proxy:

("Base","@sync","@sync()

   Wait until all dynamically-enclosed uses of \"@async\", \"@spawn\",
   \"@spawnat\" and \"@parallel\" are complete.

"),

("Base","@parallel","@parallel()

   A parallel for loop of the form

      @parallel [reducer] for var = range
          body
      end

   The specified range is partitioned and locally executed across all
   workers. In case an optional reducer function is specified,
   @parallel performs local reductions on each worker with a final
   reduction on the calling process.

   Note that without a reducer function, @parallel executes
   asynchronously, i.e. it spawns independent tasks on all available
   workers and returns immediately without waiting for completion. To
   wait for completion, prefix the call with \"@sync\", like

      @sync @parallel for var = range
          body
      end

"),

("Base","DArray","DArray(init, dims[, procs, dist])

   Construct a distributed array. The parameter \"init\" is a function
   that accepts a tuple of index ranges. This function should allocate
   a local chunk of the distributed array and initialize it for the
   specified indices. \"dims\" is the overall size of the distributed
   array. \"procs\" optionally specifies a vector of process IDs to
   use. If unspecified, the array is distributed over all worker
   processes only. Typically, when running in distributed mode, i.e.,
   \"nprocs() > 1\", this would mean that no chunk of the distributed
   array exists on the process hosting the interactive julia prompt.
   \"dist\" is an integer vector specifying how many chunks the
   distributed array should be divided into in each dimension.

   For example, the \"dfill\" function that creates a distributed
   array and fills it with a value \"v\" is implemented as:

   \"dfill(v, args...) = DArray(I->fill(v, map(length,I)), args...)\"

   The following functions are available for the \"QR\" objects:
   \"size\", \"\\\". When \"A\" is rectangular, \"\\\" will return a
   least squares solution and if the solution is not unique, the one
   with smallest norm is returned.

   Multiplication with respect to either thin or full \"Q\" is
   allowed, i.e. both \"F[:Q]*F[:R]\" and \"F[:Q]*A\" are supported. A
   \"Q\" matrix can be converted into a regular matrix with \"full()\"
   which has a named argument \"thin\".

   Note: \"qrfact\" returns multiple types because LAPACK uses
     several representations that minimize the memory storage
     requirements of products of Householder elementary reflectors, so
     that the \"Q\" and \"R\" matrices can be stored compactly rather
     as two separate dense matrices.The data contained in \"QR\" or
     \"QRPivoted\" can be used to construct the \"QRPackedQ\" type,
     which is a compact representation of the rotation matrix:

           Q = \\prod_{i=1}^{\\min(m,n)} (I - \\tau_i v_i v_i^T)

     where \\tau_i is the scale factor and v_i is the projection
     vector associated with the i^{th} Householder elementary
     reflector.The data contained in \"QRCompactWY\" can be used to
     construct the \"QRCompactWYQ\" type, which is a compact
     representation of the rotation matrix

           Q = I + Y T Y^T

     where \"Y\" is m \\times r lower trapezoidal and \"T\" is r
     \\times r upper triangular. The *compact WY* representation
     [Schreiber1989] is not to be confused with the older, *WY*
     representation [Bischof1987]. (The LAPACK documentation uses
     \"V\" in lieu of \"Y\".)

   \"JULIA_PKGDIR\" is a relative path, it is interpreted relative to
   whatever the current working directory is.

"),

("Base.Pkg","dir","dir(names...) -> String

   Equivalent to \"normpath(Pkg.dir(),names...)\" â€“ i.e. it appends
   path components to the package directory and normalizes the
   resulting path. In particular, \"Pkg.dir(pkg)\" returns the path to
   the package \"pkg\".

"),

("Base.Pkg","init","init(meta::String=DEFAULT_META, branch::String=META_BRANCH)

   Initialize \"Pkg.dir()\" as a package directory. This will be done
   automatically when the \"JULIA_PKGDIR\" is not set and
   \"Pkg.dir()\" uses its default value. As part of this process,
   clones a local METADATA git repository from the site and branch
   specified by its arguments, which are typically not provided.
   Explicit (non-default) arguments can be used to support a custom
   METADATA setup.

"),

("Base.Pkg","resolve","resolve()

   Determines an optimal, consistent set of package versions to
   install or upgrade to. The optimal set of package versions is based

   required are moved into \"Pkg.dir(\".trash\")\".

"),

("Base.Pkg","edit","edit()

   Opens \"Pkg.dir(\"REQUIRE\")\" in the editor specified by the
   \"VISUAL\" or \"EDITOR\" environment variables; when the editor
   command returns, it runs \"Pkg.resolve()\" to determine and install
   a new optimal set of installed package versions.

"),

("Base.Pkg","add","add(pkg, vers...)

   Add a requirement entry for \"pkg\" to \"Pkg.dir(\"REQUIRE\")\" and

   Remove all requirement entries for \"pkg\" from
   \"Pkg.dir(\"REQUIRE\")\" and call \"Pkg.resolve()\".

"),

("Base.Pkg","clone","clone(url[, pkg])

   Clone a package directly from the git URL \"url\". The package does
   not need to be a registered in \"Pkg.dir(\"METADATA\")\". The
   package repo is cloned by the name \"pkg\" if provided; if not
   provided, \"pkg\" is determined automatically from \"url\".

"),

("Base.Pkg","clone","clone(pkg)

   If \"pkg\" has a URL registered in \"Pkg.dir(\"METADATA\")\", clone
   it from that URL on the default branch. The package does not need

   determine a new optimal set of packages versions.

"),

("Base.Pkg","checkout","checkout(pkg[, branch=\"master\"])

   Checkout the \"Pkg.dir(pkg)\" repo to the branch \"branch\".

   Pin \"pkg\" at registered version \"version\".

"),

("Base.Pkg","free","free(pkg)

   Free the package \"pkg\" to be managed by the package manager
   again. It calls \"Pkg.resolve()\" to determine optimal package
   versions after. This is an inverse for both \"Pkg.checkout\" and

   Run the build scripts for all installed packages in depth-first
   recursive order.

"),

("Base.Pkg","build","build(pkgs...)

   Run the build script in \"deps/build.jl\" for each package in

   installed or updated packages.

"),

("Base.Pkg","generate","generate(pkg, license)

   Generate a new package named \"pkg\" with one of these license
   keys: \"\"MIT\"\" or \"\"BSD\"\". If you want to make a package
   with a different license, you can edit it afterwards. Generate

   major version is used. If \"ver\" is not provided, it defaults to
   \":patch\".

"),

("Base.Pkg","publish","publish()

   For each new package version tagged in \"METADATA\" not already
   published, make sure that the tagged package commits have been
   pushed to the repo at the registered URL for the package and if

"),

("Base.Pkg","test","test()

   Run the tests for all installed packages ensuring that each

("Base","@profile","@profile()

   \"@profile <expression>\" runs your expression while taking
   periodic backtraces.  These are appended to an internal buffer of
   backtraces.

   Clear any existing backtraces from the internal buffer.

"),

("Base.Profile","print","print([io::IO = STDOUT], [data::Vector]; format = :tree, C = false, combine = true, cols = tty_cols())

   Prints profiling results to \"io\" (by default, \"STDOUT\"). If you
   do not supply a \"data\" vector, the internal buffer of accumulated
   backtraces will be used.  \"format\" can be \":tree\" or \":flat\".
   If \"C==true\", backtraces from C and Fortran code are shown.
   \"combine==true\" merges instruction pointers that correspond to
   the same line of code.  \"cols\" controls the width of the display.

"),

("Base.Profile","print","print([io::IO = STDOUT], data::Vector, lidict::Dict; format = :tree, combine = true, cols = tty_cols())

   Prints profiling results to \"io\". This variant is used to examine
   results exported by a previous call to \"Profile.retrieve()\".
   Supply the vector \"data\" of backtraces and a dictionary
   \"lidict\" of line information.

"),

("Base.Profile","init","init(; n::Integer, delay::Float64)

   Configure the \"delay\" between backtraces (measured in seconds),
   and the number \"n\" of instruction pointers that may be stored.
   Each instruction pointer corresponds to a single line of code;
   backtraces generally consist of a long list of instruction
   pointers. Default settings can be obtained by calling this function
   with no arguments, and each can be set independently using keywords
   or in the order \"(n, delay)\".

"),

("Base.Profile","fetch","fetch() -> data

   Returns a reference to the internal buffer of backtraces. Note that
   subsequent operations, like \"Profile.clear()\", can affect
   \"data\" unless you first make a copy. Note that the values in
   \"data\" have meaning only on this machine in the current session,
   because it depends on the exact memory addresses used in JIT-
   compiling. This function is primarily for internal use;
   \"Profile.retrieve()\" may be a better choice for most users.

"),

("Base.Profile","retrieve","retrieve() -> data, lidict

   \"Exports\" profiling results in a portable format, returning the
   set of all backtraces (\"data\") and a dictionary that maps the
   (session-specific) instruction pointers in \"data\" to \"LineInfo\"
   values that store the file name, function name, and line number.
   This function allows you to save profiling results for future
   analysis.

"),


("Base","sort!","sort!(v, [alg=<algorithm>,] [by=<transform>,] [lt=<comparison>,] [rev=false])

   Sort the vector \"v\" in place. \"QuickSort\" is used by default
   for numeric arrays while \"MergeSort\" is used for other arrays.
   You can specify an algorithm to use via the \"alg\" keyword (see
   Sorting Algorithms for available algorithms). The \"by\" keyword
   lets you provide a function that will be applied to each element
   before comparison; the \"lt\" keyword allows providing a custom
   \"less than\" function; use \"rev=true\" to reverse the sorting
   order. These options are independent and can be used together in
   all possible combinations: if both \"by\" and \"lt\" are specified,
   the \"lt\" function is applied to the result of the \"by\"
   function; \"rev=true\" reverses whatever ordering specified via the
   \"by\" and \"lt\" keywords.

"),

"),

("Base","sortperm","sortperm(v, [alg=<algorithm>,] [by=<transform>,] [lt=<comparison>,] [rev=false])

   Return a permutation vector of indices of \"v\" that puts it in
   sorted order. Specify \"alg\" to choose a particular sorting
   algorithm (see Sorting Algorithms). \"MergeSort\" is used by
   default, and since it is stable, the resulting permutation will be
   the lexicographically first one that puts the input array into
   sorted order â€“ i.e. indices of equal elements appear in ascending
   order. If you choose a non-stable sorting algorithm such as
   \"QuickSort\", a different permutation that puts the array into
   order may be returned. The order is specified using the same
   keywords as \"sort!\".

"),

("Base","sortrows","sortrows(A, [alg=<algorithm>,] [by=<transform>,] [lt=<comparison>,] [rev=false])

   Sort the rows of matrix \"A\" lexicographically.

   Sort the columns of matrix \"A\" lexicographically.

"),

("Base","issorted","issorted(v, [by=<transform>,] [lt=<comparison>,] [rev=false])

   Test whether a vector is in sorted order. The \"by\", \"lt\" and
   \"rev\" keywords modify what order is considered to be sorted just
   as they do for \"sort\".

   Returns the range of indices of \"a\" which compare as equal to
   \"x\" according to the order specified by the \"by\", \"lt\" and
   \"rev\" keywords, assuming that \"a\" is already sorted in that
   order. Returns an empty range located at the insertion point if

   Returns the index of the last value in \"a\" less than or equal to
   \"x\", according to the specified order. Returns \"0\" if \"x\" is
   less than all values in \"a\".

"),

("Base","select!","select!(v, k, [by=<transform>,] [lt=<comparison>,] [rev=false])

   Partially sort the vector \"v\" in place, according to the order
   specified by \"by\", \"lt\" and \"rev\" so that the value at index
   \"k\" (or range of adjacent values if \"k\" is a range) occurs at
   the position where it would appear if the array were fully sorted
   via a non-stable algorithm. If \"k\" is a single index, that value
   is returned; if \"k\" is a range, an array of values at those
   indices is returned. Note that \"select!\" does not fully sort the
   input array.

"),

("Base","select","select(v, k, [by=<transform>,] [lt=<comparison>,] [rev=false])

   Variant of \"select!\" which copies \"v\" before partially sorting
   it, thereby returning the same thing as \"select!\" but leaving
   \"v\" unmodified.

"),

("Base","sparse","sparse(I, J, V[, m, n, combine])

   Create a sparse matrix \"S\" of dimensions \"m x n\" such that
   \"S[I[k], J[k]] = V[k]\". The \"combine\" function is used to
   combine duplicates. If \"m\" and \"n\" are not specified, they are
   set to \"max(I)\" and \"max(J)\" respectively. If the \"combine\"
   function is not supplied, duplicates are added by default.

"),

("Base","sparsevec","sparsevec(I, V[, m, combine])

   Create a sparse matrix \"S\" of size \"m x 1\" such that \"S[I[k]]
   = V[k]\". Duplicates are combined using the \"combine\" function,
   which defaults to \"+\" if it is not provided. In julia, sparse
   vectors are really just sparse matrices with one column. Given
   Julia's Compressed Sparse Columns (CSC) storage format, a sparse
   column matrix with one column is sparse, whereas a sparse row
   matrix with one row ends up being dense.

"),

("Base","sparsevec","sparsevec(D::Dict[, m])

   Create a sparse matrix of size \"m x 1\" where the row values are
   keys from the dictionary, and the nonzero values are the values
   from the dictionary.

("Base","spdiagm","spdiagm(B, d[, m, n])

   Construct a sparse diagonal matrix. \"B\" is a tuple of vectors
   containing the diagonals and \"d\" is a tuple containing the
   positions of the diagonals. In the case the input contains only one
   diagonaly, \"B\" can be a vector (instead of a tuple) and \"d\" can
   be the diagonal position (instead of a tuple), defaulting to 0
   (diagonal). Optionally, \"m\" and \"n\" specify the size of the
   resulting sparse matrix.

"),

("Base","sprand","sprand(m, n, p[, rng])

   Create a random \"m\" by \"n\" sparse matrix, in which the
   probability of any element being nonzero is independently given by
   \"p\" (and hence the mean density of nonzeros is also exactly
   \"p\"). Nonzero values are sampled from the distribution specified
   by \"rng\". The uniform distribution is used in case \"rng\" is not
   specified.

"),

("Base","sprandn","sprandn(m, n, p)

   Create a random \"m\" by \"n\" sparse matrix with the specified
   (independent) probability \"p\" of any entry being nonzero, where

   Compute the elimination tree of a symmetric sparse matrix \"A\"
   from \"triu(A)\" and, optionally, its post-ordering permutation.

"),

("Base","symperm","symperm(A, p)

   Return the symmetric permutation of A, which is \"A[p,p]\". A
   should be symmetric and sparse, where only the upper triangular
   part of the matrix is stored. This algorithm ignores the lower
   triangular part of the matrix. Only the upper triangular part of
   the result is returned as well.

"),

("Base","nonzeros","nonzeros(A)

   Return a vector of the structural nonzero values in sparse matrix
   \"A\". This includes zeros that are explicitly stored in the sparse
   matrix. The returned vector points directly to the internal nonzero
   storage of \"A\", and any modifications to the returned vector will
   mutate \"A\" as well.

"),

("Base.Test","@test","@test(ex)

   Test the expression \"ex\" and calls the current handler to handle
   the result.
