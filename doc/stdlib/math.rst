   This function computes a floating point representation of the modulus after division by numerically exact 2pi, and is therefore not exactly the same as mod(x,2pi), which would compute the modulus of ``x`` relative to division by the floating-point number 2pi.

.. function:: rem(x, y)
              %(x, y)

   .. Docstring generated from Julia source

.. _\::
.. function:: \:(start, [step], stop)

   .. Docstring generated from Julia source

   Range operator. ``a:b`` constructs a range from ``a`` to ``b`` with a step size of 1, and ``a:s:b`` is similar but uses a step size of ``s``. These syntaxes call the function ``colon``.
   The colon is also used in indexing to select whole dimensions.

.. function:: colon(start, [step], stop)

   .. Docstring generated from Julia source

   Called by ``:`` syntax for constructing ranges.

.. function:: range(start, [step], length)

   .. Docstring generated from Julia source

   Construct a range by length, given a starting value and optional step (defaults to 1).

.. _==:
.. function:: ==(x, y)

   .. Docstring generated from Julia source

   Generic equality operator, giving a single ``Bool`` result. Falls back to ``===``\ . Should be implemented for all types with a notion of equality, based on the abstract value that an instance represents. For example, all numeric types are compared by numeric value, ignoring type. Strings are compared as sequences of characters, ignoring encoding.

   Follows IEEE semantics for floating-point numbers.

   Collections should generally implement ``==`` by calling ``==`` recursively on all contents.

   New numeric types should implement this function for two arguments of the new type, and handle comparison to other types via promotion rules where possible.

.. _!=:
.. function:: !=(x, y)
              ≠(x,y)

   .. Docstring generated from Julia source

   Not-equals comparison operator. Always gives the opposite answer as ``==``\ . New types should generally not implement this, and rely on the fallback definition ``!=(x,y) = !(x==y)`` instead.

.. _===:
.. function:: ===(x, y)
              ≡(x,y)

   .. Docstring generated from Julia source

   See the :func:`is` operator

   .. Docstring generated from Julia source

   Equivalent to ``!is(x, y)``

.. _<:
.. function:: <(x, y)

   .. Docstring generated from Julia source

   Less-than comparison operator. New numeric types should implement this function for two arguments of the new type. Because of the behavior of floating-point NaN values, ``<`` implements a partial order. Types with a canonical partial order should implement ``<``\ , and types with a canonical total order should implement ``isless``\ .

.. _<=:
.. function:: <=(x, y)
              ≤(x,y)

   .. Docstring generated from Julia source

   Less-than-or-equals comparison operator.

.. _>:
.. function:: >(x, y)

   .. Docstring generated from Julia source

   Greater-than comparison operator. Generally, new types should implement ``<`` instead of this function, and rely on the fallback definition ``>(x,y) = y<x``\ .

.. _>=:
.. function:: >=(x, y)
              ≥(x,y)

   .. Docstring generated from Julia source

.. function:: .==(x, y)

   .. Docstring generated from Julia source

              .≥(x,y)

   .. Docstring generated from Julia source

   Element-wise greater-than-or-equals comparison operator.

.. function:: cmp(x,y)

   .. Docstring generated from Julia source

   Return -1, 0, or 1 depending on whether ``x`` is less than, equal to, or greater than ``y``\ , respectively. Uses the total order implemented by ``isless``\ . For floating-point numbers, uses ``<`` but throws an error for unordered arguments.

Mathematical Functions
----------------------

.. function:: isapprox(x, y; rtol::Real=sqrt(eps), atol::Real=0)

   .. Docstring generated from Julia source

   Inexact equality comparison: ``true`` if ``norm(x-y) <= atol + rtol*max(norm(x), norm(y))``\ . The default ``atol`` is zero and the default ``rtol`` depends on the types of ``x`` and ``y``\ .

   For real or complex floating-point values, ``rtol`` defaults to ``sqrt(eps(typeof(real(x-y))))``\ . This corresponds to requiring equality of about half of the significand digits. For other types, ``rtol`` defaults to zero.

   ``x`` and ``y`` may also be arrays of numbers, in which case ``norm`` defaults to ``vecnorm`` but may be changed by passing a ``norm::Function`` keyword argument. (For numbers, ``norm`` is the same thing as ``abs``\ .)

   The binary operator ``≈`` is equivalent to ``isapprox`` with the default arguments, and ``x ≉ y`` is equivalent to ``!isapprox(x,y)``\ .

.. function:: expm1(x)

   .. Docstring generated from Julia source

   Accurately compute :math:`e^x-1`\ .

.. function:: round([T,] x, [digits, [base]], [r::RoundingMode])

   .. Docstring generated from Julia source

   ``round(x)`` rounds ``x`` to an integer value according to the default
   rounding mode (see :func:`rounding`), returning a value of the same type as
   ``x``. By default (:obj:`RoundNearest`), this will round to the nearest
   integer, with ties (fractional values of 0.5) being rounded to the even
   integer.

   .. doctest::

      julia> round(1.7)
      2.0

      julia> round(1.5)
      2.0

      julia> round(2.5)
      2.0

   The optional :obj:`RoundingMode` argument will change how the number gets rounded.

   ``round(T, x, [r::RoundingMode])`` converts the result to type ``T``, throwing an
   :exc:`InexactError` if the value is not representable.

   ``round(x, digits)`` rounds to the specified number of digits after the
   decimal place (or before if negative). ``round(x, digits, base)`` rounds
   using a base other than 10.

   .. doctest::

      julia> round(pi, 2)
      3.14

      julia> round(pi, 3, 2)
      3.125

   .. note::

      Rounding to specified digits in bases other than 2 can be inexact when
      operating on binary floating point numbers. For example, the ``Float64``
      value represented by ``1.15`` is actually *less* than 1.15, yet will be
      rounded to 1.2.

      .. doctest::

         julia> x = 1.15
         1.15

         julia> @sprintf "%.20f" x
         "1.14999999999999991118"

         julia> x < 115//100

.. data:: RoundingMode

   A type which controls rounding behavior. Currently supported rounding modes are:

   - :obj:`RoundNearest` (default)
   - :obj:`RoundNearestTiesAway`
   - :obj:`RoundNearestTiesUp`
   - :obj:`RoundToZero`
   - :obj:`RoundUp`
   - :obj:`RoundDown`

.. data:: RoundNearest

   The default rounding mode. Rounds to the nearest integer, with ties
   (fractional values of 0.5) being rounded to the nearest even integer.

.. data:: RoundNearestTiesAway

   Rounds to nearest integer, with ties rounded away from zero (C/C++
   :func:`round` behaviour).

.. data:: RoundNearestTiesUp

   Rounds to nearest integer, with ties rounded toward positive infinity
   (Java/JavaScript :func:`round` behaviour).

.. data:: RoundToZero

   :func:`round` using this rounding mode is an alias for :func:`trunc`.

   :func:`round` using this rounding mode is an alias for :func:`ceil`.

.. data:: RoundDown

   :func:`round` using this rounding mode is an alias for :func:`floor`.

.. function:: round(z, RoundingModeReal, RoundingModeImaginary)

   .. Docstring generated from Julia source

   Returns the nearest integral value of the same type as the complex-valued
   ``z`` to ``z``, breaking ties using the specified :obj:`RoundingMode`\ s.
   The first :obj:`RoundingMode` is used for rounding the real components while
   the second is used for rounding the imaginary components.

.. function:: ceil([T,] x, [digits, [base]])

   .. Docstring generated from Julia source

   ``ceil(x)`` returns the nearest integral value of the same type as ``x``
   that is greater than or equal to ``x``.

   ``ceil(T, x)`` converts the result to type ``T``, throwing an
   ``InexactError`` if the value is not representable.

   ``digits`` and ``base`` work as for :func:`round`.

.. function:: floor([T,] x, [digits, [base]])

   .. Docstring generated from Julia source

   ``floor(x)`` returns the nearest integral value of the same type as ``x``
   that is less than or equal to ``x``.

   ``floor(T, x)`` converts the result to type ``T``, throwing an
   ``InexactError`` if the value is not representable.

   ``digits`` and ``base`` work as for :func:`round`.

.. function:: trunc([T,] x, [digits, [base]])

   .. Docstring generated from Julia source

   ``trunc(x)`` returns the nearest integral value of the same type as ``x`` whose absolute
   value is less than or equal to ``x``.

   ``trunc(T, x)`` converts the result to type ``T``, throwing an
   ``InexactError`` if the value is not representable.

.. function:: Base.checked_neg(x)

   .. Docstring generated from Julia source

.. function:: mean(v[, region])

   .. Docstring generated from Julia source

   Compute the mean of whole array ``v``\ , or optionally along the dimensions in ``region``\ . Note: Julia does not ignore ``NaN`` values in the computation. For applications requiring the handling of missing data, the ``DataArray`` package is recommended.

   Compute the middle of a range, which consists in computing the mean of its extrema. Since a range is sorted, the mean is performed with the first and last element.

.. function:: middle(array)

   .. Docstring generated from Julia source

   Compute the middle of an array, which consists in finding its extrema and then computing their mean.

.. function:: median(v[, region])

   .. Docstring generated from Julia source

   Compute the median of whole array ``v``\ , or optionally along the dimensions in ``region``\ . For even number of elements no exact median element exists, so the result is equivalent to calculating mean of two median elements. ``NaN`` is returned if the data contains any ``NaN`` values. For applications requiring the handling of missing data, the ``DataArrays`` package is recommended.

.. function:: median!(v)

   .. Docstring generated from Julia source

   Like ``median``\ , but may overwrite the input vector.

.. function:: hist(v[, n]) -> e, counts

   .. Docstring generated from Julia source

   Compute the histogram of ``v``\ , optionally using approximately ``n`` bins. The return values are a range ``e``\ , which correspond to the edges of the bins, and ``counts`` containing the number of elements of ``v`` in each bin. Note: Julia does not ignore ``NaN`` values in the computation.

.. function:: hist(v, e) -> e, counts

   .. Docstring generated from Julia source

   Compute the histogram of ``v`` using a vector/range ``e`` as the edges for the bins. The result will be a vector of length ``length(e) - 1``\ , such that the element at location ``i`` satisfies ``sum(e[i] .< v .<= e[i+1])``\ . Note: Julia does not ignore ``NaN`` values in the computation.

.. function:: hist!(counts, v, e) -> e, counts

   .. Docstring generated from Julia source

   Compute the histogram of ``v``\ , using a vector/range ``e`` as the edges for the bins. This function writes the resultant counts to a pre-allocated array ``counts``\ .

.. function:: hist2d(M, e1, e2) -> (edge1, edge2, counts)

   .. Docstring generated from Julia source

   Compute a "2d histogram" of a set of N points specified by N-by-2 matrix ``M``\ . Arguments ``e1`` and ``e2`` are bins for each dimension, specified either as integer bin counts or vectors of bin edges. The result is a tuple of ``edge1`` (the bin edges used in the first dimension), ``edge2`` (the bin edges used in the second dimension), and ``counts``\ , a histogram matrix of size ``(length(edge1)-1, length(edge2)-1)``\ . Note: Julia does not ignore ``NaN`` values in the computation.

.. function:: hist2d!(counts, M, e1, e2) -> (e1, e2, counts)

   .. Docstring generated from Julia source

   Compute a "2d histogram" with respect to the bins delimited by the edges given in ``e1`` and ``e2``\ . This function writes the results to a pre-allocated array ``counts``\ .

.. function:: histrange(v, n)

   .. Docstring generated from Julia source

   Compute *nice* bin ranges for the edges of a histogram of ``v``\ , using approximately ``n`` bins. The resulting step sizes will be 1, 2 or 5 multiplied by a power of 10. Note: Julia does not ignore ``NaN`` values in the computation.

.. function:: midpoints(e)

   .. Docstring generated from Julia source

   Compute the midpoints of the bins with edges ``e``\ . The result is a vector/range of length ``length(e) - 1``\ . Note: Julia does not ignore ``NaN`` values in the computation.

.. function:: quantile(v, ps)

   .. Docstring generated from Julia source

   Compute the quantiles of a vector ``v`` at a specified set of probability values ``ps``\ . Note: Julia does not ignore ``NaN`` values in the computation.

.. function:: quantile(v, p)

   .. Docstring generated from Julia source

   Compute the quantile of a vector ``v`` at the probability ``p``\ . Note: Julia does not ignore ``NaN`` values in the computation.

.. function:: quantile!(v, p)

   .. Docstring generated from Julia source

   Like ``quantile``\ , but overwrites the input vector.

.. function:: cov(x[, corrected=true])

   .. Docstring generated from Julia source

   Compute the variance of the vector ``x``\ . If ``corrected`` is ``true`` (the default) then the sum is scaled with ``n-1`` wheares the sum is scaled with ``n`` if ``corrected`` is ``false`` where ``n = length(x)``\ .

.. function:: cov(X[, vardim=1, corrected=true])

   .. Docstring generated from Julia source

   Compute the covariance matrix of the matrix ``X`` along the dimension ``vardim``\ . If ``corrected`` is ``true`` (the default) then the sum is scaled with ``n-1`` wheares the sum is scaled with ``n`` if ``corrected`` is ``false`` where ``n = size(X, vardim)``\ .

.. function:: cov(x, y[, corrected=true])

Signal Processing
-----------------

Fast Fourier transform (FFT) functions in Julia are
implemented by calling functions from `FFTW
<http://www.fftw.org>`_. By default, Julia does not use multi-threaded
FFTW. Higher performance may be obtained by experimenting with
multi-threading. Use ``FFTW.set_num_threads(np)`` to use ``np`` threads.

.. function:: fft(A [, dims])

   .. Docstring generated from Julia source

   Performs a multidimensional FFT of the array ``A``\ .  The optional ``dims`` argument specifies an iterable subset of dimensions (e.g. an integer, range, tuple, or array) to transform along.  Most efficient if the size of ``A`` along the transformed dimensions is a product of small primes; see ``nextprod()``\ .  See also ``plan_fft()`` for even greater efficiency.

   A one-dimensional FFT computes the one-dimensional discrete Fourier transform (DFT) as defined by

   .. math::

       \operatorname{DFT}(A)[k] =
         \sum_{n=1}^{\operatorname{length}(A)}
         \exp\left(-i\frac{2\pi
         (n-1)(k-1)}{\operatorname{length}(A)} \right) A[n].

   A multidimensional FFT simply performs this operation along each transformed dimension of ``A``\ .

   Higher performance is usually possible with multi-threading. Use ``FFTW.set_num_threads(np)`` to use ``np`` threads, if you have ``np`` processors.

.. function:: fft!(A [, dims])

   .. Docstring generated from Julia source

   Same as :func:`fft`, but operates in-place on ``A``,
   which must be an array of complex floating-point numbers.

.. function:: ifft(A [, dims])

   .. Docstring generated from Julia source

   Multidimensional inverse FFT.

   A one-dimensional inverse FFT computes

   .. math::

       \operatorname{IDFT}(A)[k] = \frac{1}{\operatorname{length}(A)}
       \sum_{n=1}^{\operatorname{length}(A)} \exp\left(+i\frac{2\pi (n-1)(k-1)}
       {\operatorname{length}(A)} \right) A[n].

   A multidimensional inverse FFT simply performs this operation along each transformed dimension of ``A``\ .

.. function:: ifft!(A [, dims])

   .. Docstring generated from Julia source

   Same as :func:`ifft`, but operates in-place on ``A``.

.. function:: bfft(A [, dims])

   .. Docstring generated from Julia source

   Similar to :func:`ifft`, but computes an unnormalized inverse (backward)
   transform, which must be divided by the product of the sizes of the
   transformed dimensions in order to obtain the inverse. (This is slightly
   more efficient than :func:`ifft` because it omits a scaling step, which in
   some applications can be combined with other computational steps elsewhere.)

   .. math::

      \operatorname{BDFT}(A)[k] = \operatorname{length}(A) \operatorname{IDFT}(A)[k]

.. function:: bfft!(A [, dims])

   .. Docstring generated from Julia source

   Same as :func:`bfft`, but operates in-place on ``A``.

.. function:: plan_fft(A [, dims]; flags=FFTW.ESTIMATE;  timelimit=Inf)

   .. Docstring generated from Julia source

   Pre-plan an optimized FFT along given dimensions (``dims``) of arrays
   matching the shape and type of ``A``.  (The first two arguments have
   the same meaning as for :func:`fft`.)  Returns an object ``P`` which
   represents the linear operator computed by the FFT, and which contains
   all of the information needed to compute ``fft(A, dims)`` quickly.

   To apply ``P`` to an array ``A``, use ``P * A``; in general, the
   syntax for applying plans is much like that of matrices.  (A plan
   can only be applied to arrays of the same size as the ``A`` for
   which the plan was created.)  You can also apply a plan with a
   preallocated output array ``Â`` by calling ``A_mul_B!(Â, plan,
   A)``.  You can compute the inverse-transform plan by ``inv(P)`` and
   apply the inverse plan with ``P \ Â`` (the inverse plan is cached
   and reused for subsequent calls to ``inv`` or ``\``), and apply the
   inverse plan to a pre-allocated output array ``A`` with
   ``A_ldiv_B!(A, P, Â)``.

   The ``flags`` argument is a bitwise-or of FFTW planner flags, defaulting
   to ``FFTW.ESTIMATE``.  e.g. passing ``FFTW.MEASURE`` or ``FFTW.PATIENT``
   will instead spend several seconds (or more) benchmarking different
   possible FFT algorithms and picking the fastest one; see the FFTW manual
   for more information on planner flags.  The optional ``timelimit`` argument
   specifies a rough upper bound on the allowed planning time, in seconds.
   Passing ``FFTW.MEASURE`` or ``FFTW.PATIENT`` may cause the input array ``A``
   to be overwritten with zeros during plan creation.

   :func:`plan_fft!` is the same as :func:`plan_fft` but creates a plan
   that operates in-place on its argument (which must be an array of
   complex floating-point numbers).  :func:`plan_ifft` and so on
   are similar but produce plans that perform the equivalent of
   the inverse transforms :func:`ifft` and so on.

.. function:: plan_ifft(A [, dims]; flags=FFTW.ESTIMATE;  timelimit=Inf)

   .. Docstring generated from Julia source

   Same as :func:`plan_fft`, but produces a plan that performs inverse transforms
   :func:`ifft`.

.. function:: plan_bfft(A [, dims]; flags=FFTW.ESTIMATE;  timelimit=Inf)

   .. Docstring generated from Julia source

   Same as :func:`plan_fft`, but produces a plan that performs an unnormalized
   backwards transform :func:`bfft`.

.. function:: plan_fft!(A [, dims]; flags=FFTW.ESTIMATE;  timelimit=Inf)

   .. Docstring generated from Julia source

   Same as :func:`plan_fft`, but operates in-place on ``A``.

.. function:: plan_ifft!(A [, dims]; flags=FFTW.ESTIMATE;  timelimit=Inf)

   .. Docstring generated from Julia source

   Same as :func:`plan_ifft`, but operates in-place on ``A``.

.. function:: plan_bfft!(A [, dims]; flags=FFTW.ESTIMATE;  timelimit=Inf)

   .. Docstring generated from Julia source

   Same as :func:`plan_bfft`, but operates in-place on ``A``.

.. function:: rfft(A [, dims])

   .. Docstring generated from Julia source

   Multidimensional FFT of a real array ``A``, exploiting the fact that
   the transform has conjugate symmetry in order to save roughly half
   the computational time and storage costs compared with :func:`fft`.
   If ``A`` has size ``(n_1, ..., n_d)``, the result has size
   ``(div(n_1,2)+1, ..., n_d)``.

   The optional ``dims`` argument specifies an iterable subset of one or
   more dimensions of ``A`` to transform, similar to :func:`fft`.  Instead
   of (roughly) halving the first dimension of ``A`` in the result, the
   ``dims[1]`` dimension is (roughly) halved in the same way.

.. function:: irfft(A, d [, dims])

   .. Docstring generated from Julia source

   Inverse of :func:`rfft`: for a complex array ``A``, gives the
   corresponding real array whose FFT yields ``A`` in the first half.
   As for :func:`rfft`, ``dims`` is an optional subset of dimensions
   to transform, defaulting to ``1:ndims(A)``.

   ``d`` is the length of the transformed real array along the ``dims[1]``
   dimension, which must satisfy ``div(d,2)+1 == size(A,dims[1])``.
   (This parameter cannot be inferred from ``size(A)`` since both
   ``2*size(A,dims[1])-2`` as well as ``2*size(A,dims[1])-1`` are valid sizes
   for the transformed real array.)

.. function:: brfft(A, d [, dims])

   .. Docstring generated from Julia source

   Similar to :func:`irfft` but computes an unnormalized inverse transform
   (similar to :func:`bfft`), which must be divided by the product
   of the sizes of the transformed dimensions (of the real output array)
   in order to obtain the inverse transform.

.. function:: plan_rfft(A [, dims]; flags=FFTW.ESTIMATE;  timelimit=Inf)

   .. Docstring generated from Julia source

   Pre-plan an optimized real-input FFT, similar to :func:`plan_fft`

   for :func:`rfft`.

.. function:: plan_brfft(A, d [, dims]; flags=FFTW.ESTIMATE;  timelimit=Inf)

   .. Docstring generated from Julia source

   Pre-plan an optimized real-input unnormalized transform, similar to
   :func:`plan_rfft` except for :func:`brfft` instead of :func:`rfft`.

   .. Docstring generated from Julia source

   Pre-plan an optimized inverse real-input FFT, similar to :func:`plan_rfft`
   except for :func:`irfft` and :func:`brfft`, respectively.  The first
   three arguments have the same meaning as for :func:`irfft`.

.. function:: dct(A [, dims])

   .. Docstring generated from Julia source

   Performs a multidimensional type-II discrete cosine transform (DCT)
   of the array ``A``, using the unitary normalization of the DCT.
   The optional ``dims`` argument specifies an iterable subset of
   dimensions (e.g. an integer, range, tuple, or array) to transform
   along.  Most efficient if the size of ``A`` along the transformed
   dimensions is a product of small primes; see :func:`nextprod`.  See
   also :func:`plan_dct` for even greater efficiency.

.. function:: dct!(A [, dims])

   .. Docstring generated from Julia source

   Same as :func:`dct!`, except that it operates in-place
   on ``A``, which must be an array of real or complex floating-point
   values.

.. function:: idct(A [, dims])

   .. Docstring generated from Julia source

   Computes the multidimensional inverse discrete cosine transform (DCT)
   of the array ``A`` (technically, a type-III DCT with the unitary
   normalization).
   The optional ``dims`` argument specifies an iterable subset of
   dimensions (e.g. an integer, range, tuple, or array) to transform
   along.  Most efficient if the size of ``A`` along the transformed
   dimensions is a product of small primes; see :func:`nextprod`.  See
   also :func:`plan_idct` for even greater efficiency.

.. function:: idct!(A [, dims])

   .. Docstring generated from Julia source

   Same as :func:`idct!`, but operates in-place on ``A``.

.. function:: plan_dct(A [, dims [, flags [, timelimit]]])

   .. Docstring generated from Julia source

   Pre-plan an optimized discrete cosine transform (DCT), similar to
   :func:`plan_fft` except producing a function that computes :func:`dct`.
   The first two arguments have the same meaning as for :func:`dct`.

.. function:: plan_dct!(A [, dims [, flags [, timelimit]]])

   .. Docstring generated from Julia source

   Same as :func:`plan_dct`, but operates in-place on ``A``.

.. function:: plan_idct(A [, dims [, flags [, timelimit]]])

   .. Docstring generated from Julia source

   Pre-plan an optimized inverse discrete cosine transform (DCT), similar to
   :func:`plan_fft` except producing a function that computes :func:`idct`.
   The first two arguments have the same meaning as for :func:`idct`.

.. function:: plan_idct!(A [, dims [, flags [, timelimit]]])

   .. Docstring generated from Julia source

   Same as :func:`plan_idct`, but operates in-place on ``A``.

.. currentmodule:: Base.FFTW

The following functions are defined within the ``Base.FFTW`` module.

.. function:: r2r(A, kind [, dims])

   .. Docstring generated from Julia source

   Performs a multidimensional real-input/real-output (r2r) transform
   of type ``kind`` of the array ``A``, as defined in the FFTW manual.
   ``kind`` specifies either a discrete cosine transform of various types
   (``FFTW.REDFT00``, ``FFTW.REDFT01``, ``FFTW.REDFT10``, or
   ``FFTW.REDFT11``), a discrete sine transform of various types
   (``FFTW.RODFT00``, ``FFTW.RODFT01``, ``FFTW.RODFT10``, or
   ``FFTW.RODFT11``), a real-input DFT with halfcomplex-format output
   (``FFTW.R2HC`` and its inverse ``FFTW.HC2R``), or a discrete
   Hartley transform (``FFTW.DHT``).  The ``kind`` argument may be
   an array or tuple in order to specify different transform types
   along the different dimensions of ``A``; ``kind[end]`` is used
   for any unspecified dimensions.  See the FFTW manual for precise
   definitions of these transform types, at http://www.fftw.org/doc.

   The optional ``dims`` argument specifies an iterable subset of
   dimensions (e.g. an integer, range, tuple, or array) to transform
   along. ``kind[i]`` is then the transform type for ``dims[i]``,
   with ``kind[end]`` being used for ``i > length(kind)``.

.. currentmodule:: Base

Numerical Integration
---------------------

Although several external packages are available for numeric integration
and solution of ordinary differential equations, we also provide
some built-in integration support in Julia.

.. function:: quadgk(f, a,b,c...; reltol=sqrt(eps), abstol=0, maxevals=10^7, order=7, norm=vecnorm)

   .. Docstring generated from Julia source

   Numerically integrate the function ``f(x)`` from ``a`` to ``b``\ , and optionally over additional intervals ``b`` to ``c`` and so on. Keyword options include a relative error tolerance ``reltol`` (defaults to ``sqrt(eps)`` in the precision of the endpoints), an absolute error tolerance ``abstol`` (defaults to 0), a maximum number of function evaluations ``maxevals`` (defaults to ``10^7``\ ), and the ``order`` of the integration rule (defaults to 7).

   Returns a pair ``(I,E)`` of the estimated integral ``I`` and an estimated upper bound on the absolute error ``E``\ . If ``maxevals`` is not exceeded then ``E <= max(abstol, reltol*norm(I))`` will hold. (Note that it is useful to specify a positive ``abstol`` in cases where ``norm(I)`` may be zero.)

   The endpoints ``a`` etcetera can also be complex (in which case the integral is performed over straight-line segments in the complex plane). If the endpoints are ``BigFloat``\ , then the integration will be performed in ``BigFloat`` precision as well (note: it is advisable to increase the integration ``order`` in rough proportion to the precision, for smooth integrands). More generally, the precision is set by the precision of the integration endpoints (promoted to floating-point types).

   The integrand ``f(x)`` can return any numeric scalar, vector, or matrix type, or in fact any type supporting ``+``\ , ``-``\ , multiplication by real values, and a ``norm`` (i.e., any normed vector space). Alternatively, a different norm can be specified by passing a ``norm``\ -like function as the ``norm`` keyword argument (which defaults to ``vecnorm``\ ).

   [Only one-dimensional integrals are provided by this function. For multi-dimensional integration (cubature), there are many different algorithms (often much better than simple nested 1d integrals) and the optimal choice tends to be very problem-dependent. See the Julia external-package listing for available algorithms for multidimensional integration or other specialized tasks (such as integrals of highly oscillatory or singular functions).]

   The algorithm is an adaptive Gauss-Kronrod integration technique: the integral in each interval is estimated using a Kronrod rule (``2*order+1`` points) and the error is estimated using an embedded Gauss rule (``order`` points). The interval with the largest error is then subdivided into two intervals and the process is repeated until the desired error tolerance is achieved.

   These quadrature rules work best for smooth functions within each interval, so if your function has a known discontinuity or other singularity, it is best to subdivide your interval to put the singularity at an endpoint. For example, if ``f`` has a discontinuity at ``x=0.7`` and you want to integrate from 0 to 1, you should use ``quadgk(f, 0,0.7,1)`` to subdivide the interval at the point of discontinuity. The integrand is never evaluated exactly at the endpoints of the intervals, so it is possible to integrate functions that diverge at the endpoints as long as the singularity is integrable (for example, a ``log(x)`` or ``1/sqrt(x)`` singularity).

   For real-valued endpoints, the starting and/or ending points may be infinite. (A coordinate transformation is performed internally to map the infinite interval to a finite one.)
