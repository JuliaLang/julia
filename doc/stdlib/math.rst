   This function computes a floating point representation of the modulus after division by numerically exact ``2π``\ , and is therefore not exactly the same as ``mod(x,2π)``\ , which would compute the modulus of ``x`` relative to division by the floating-point number ``2π``\ .

.. function:: fldmod1(x, y)

.. _<<:
.. function:: <<(x, n)

   .. Docstring generated from Julia source

   Left bit shift operator, ``x << n``\ . For ``n >= 0``\ , the result is ``x`` shifted left by ``n`` bits, filling with ``0``\ s. This is equivalent to ``x * 2^n``\ . For ``n < 0``\ , this is equivalent to ``x >> -n``\ .

   .. doctest::

       julia> Int8(3) << 2
       12

       julia> bits(Int8(3))
       "00000011"

For ``n >= 0``\ , the result is ``x`` shifted right by ``n`` bits, where ``n >= 0``\ , filling with ``0``\ s if ``x >= 0``\ , ``1``\ s if ``x < 0``\ , preserving the sign of ``x``\ . This is equivalent to ``fld(x, 2^n)``\ . For ``n < 0``\ , this is equivalent to ``x << -n``\ .

   .. doctest::

       julia> Int8(13) >> 2
       3

       julia> bits(Int8(60))

   See also :func:`>>`\ , :func:`<<`\ .

.. _\::
.. function:: :(start, [step], stop)

   .. Docstring generated from Julia source

   Range operator. ``a:b`` constructs a range from ``a`` to ``b`` with a step size of 1, and ``a:s:b`` is similar but uses a step size of ``s``\ . These syntaxes call the function ``colon``\ . The colon is also used in indexing to select whole dimensions.

.. function:: colon(start, [step], stop)

   .. Docstring generated from Julia source

   Called by ``:`` syntax for constructing ranges.

.. function:: range(start, [step], length)

   .. Docstring generated from Julia source

   Construct a range by length, given a starting value and optional step (defaults to 1).

.. function:: Base.OneTo(n)

   .. Docstring generated from Julia source

   Define an ``AbstractUnitRange`` that behaves like ``1:n``\ , with the added distinction that the lower limit is guaranteed (by the type system) to be 1.

.. _==:
.. function:: ==(x, y)

   .. Docstring generated from Julia source

   Generic equality operator, giving a single ``Bool`` result. Falls back to ``===``\ . Should be implemented for all types with a notion of equality, based on the abstract value that an instance represents. For example, all numeric types are compared by numeric value, ignoring type. Strings are compared as sequences of characters, ignoring encoding.

   Follows IEEE semantics for floating-point numbers.

   Collections should generally implement ``==`` by calling ``==`` recursively on all contents.

   New numeric types should implement this function for two arguments of the new type, and handle comparison to other types via promotion rules where possible.

.. _!=:
.. function:: !=(x, y)
              ≠(x,y)

   .. Docstring generated from Julia source

   Not-equals comparison operator. Always gives the opposite answer as ``==``\ . New types should generally not implement this, and rely on the fallback definition ``!=(x,y) = !(x==y)`` instead.

.. _!==:
.. function:: !==(x, y)
              ≢(x,y)

   .. Docstring generated from Julia source

   Equivalent to ``!(x === y)``\ .

.. _<:
.. function:: <(x, y)

   .. Docstring generated from Julia source

   Less-than comparison operator. New numeric types should implement this function for two arguments of the new type. Because of the behavior of floating-point NaN values, ``<`` implements a partial order. Types with a canonical partial order should implement ``<``\ , and types with a canonical total order should implement ``isless``\ .

.. _<=:
.. function:: <=(x, y)
              ≤(x,y)

   .. Docstring generated from Julia source

   Less-than-or-equals comparison operator.

.. _>:
.. function:: >(x, y)

   .. Docstring generated from Julia source

   Greater-than comparison operator. Generally, new types should implement ``<`` instead of this function, and rely on the fallback definition ``>(x,y) = y<x``\ .

              ≥(x,y)

   .. Docstring generated from Julia source

.. _.>:
.. function:: .>(x, y)

   .. Docstring generated from Julia source

   Element-wise greater-than comparison operator.

.. _.>=:
.. function:: .>=(x, y)
              .≥(x,y)

   .. Docstring generated from Julia source

   Element-wise greater-than-or-equals comparison operator.

.. function:: cmp(x,y)

   .. Docstring generated from Julia source

   Return -1, 0, or 1 depending on whether ``x`` is less than, equal to, or greater than ``y``\ , respectively. Uses the total order implemented by ``isless``\ . For floating-point numbers, uses ``<`` but throws an error for unordered arguments.

Mathematical Functions
----------------------

.. function:: isapprox(x, y; rtol::Real=sqrt(eps), atol::Real=0)

   .. Docstring generated from Julia source

   Inexact equality comparison: ``true`` if ``norm(x-y) <= atol + rtol*max(norm(x), norm(y))``\ . The default ``atol`` is zero and the default ``rtol`` depends on the types of ``x`` and ``y``\ .

   For real or complex floating-point values, ``rtol`` defaults to ``sqrt(eps(typeof(real(x-y))))``\ . This corresponds to requiring equality of about half of the significand digits. For other types, ``rtol`` defaults to zero.

   ``x`` and ``y`` may also be arrays of numbers, in which case ``norm`` defaults to ``vecnorm`` but may be changed by passing a ``norm::Function`` keyword argument. (For numbers, ``norm`` is the same thing as ``abs``\ .) When ``x`` and ``y`` are arrays, if ``norm(x-y)`` is not finite (i.e. ``±Inf`` or ``NaN``\ ), the comparison falls back to checking whether all elements of ``x`` and ``y`` are approximately equal component-wise.

   The binary operator ``≈`` is equivalent to ``isapprox`` with the default arguments, and ``x ≉ y`` is equivalent to ``!isapprox(x,y)``\ .

   .. Docstring generated from Julia source

   Rounds ``x`` to an integer value according to the provided :obj:`RoundingMode`\ , returning a value of the same type as ``x``\ . When not specifying a rounding mode the global mode will be used (see :func:`rounding`\ ), which by default is round to the nearest integer (:obj:`RoundNearest` mode), with ties (fractional values of 0.5) being rounded to the nearest even integer.

   .. doctest::

       julia> round(pi, 2)
       3.14

       julia> round(pi, 3, 2)
       3.125

   .. note::
      Rounding to specified digits in bases other than 2 can be inexact when operating on binary floating point numbers. For example, the ``Float64`` value represented by ``1.15`` is actually *less* than 1.15, yet will be rounded to 1.2.

      .. doctest::

          julia> x = 1.15
          1.15

          julia> @sprintf "%.20f" x

          julia> x < 115//100
          true

          julia> round(x, 1)
          1.2

.. function:: abs(x)

   .. Docstring generated from Julia source

   The absolute value of ``x``\ .

   When ``abs`` is applied to signed integers, overflow may occur, resulting in the return of a negative value. This overflow occurs only when ``abs`` is applied to the minimum representable value of a signed integer. That is, when ``x == typemin(typeof(x))``\ , ``abs(x) == x < 0``\ , not ``-x`` as might be expected.

.. function:: Base.checked_abs(x)

   .. Docstring generated from Julia source

       (6,-3,1)

   .. doctest::

       julia> gcdx(240, 46)
       (2,-9,47)

   .. note::
      Bézout coefficients are *not* uniquely defined. ``gcdx`` returns the minimal Bézout coefficients that are computed by the extended Euclidean algorithm. (Ref: D. Knuth, TAoCP, 2/e, p. 325, Algorithm X.) For signed integers, these coefficients ``u`` and ``v`` are minimal in the sense that :math:`|u| < |y/d|` and :math:`|v| < |x/d|`\ . Furthermore, the signs of ``u`` and ``v`` are chosen so that ``d`` is positive. For unsigned integers, the coefficients ``u`` and ``v`` might be near their ``typemax``\ , and the identity then holds only via the unsigned integers' modulo arithmetic.

.. function:: besselh(nu, [k=1,] x)

   .. Docstring generated from Julia source

   Bessel function of the third kind of order ``nu`` (the Hankel function). ``k`` is either 1 or 2, selecting :func:`hankelh1` or :func:`hankelh2`\ , respectively. ``k`` defaults to 1 if it is omitted. (See also :func:`besselhx` for an exponentially scaled variant.)

.. function:: besselhx(nu, [k=1,] z)

   .. Docstring generated from Julia source

   Compute the scaled Hankel function :math:`\exp(∓iz) H_ν^{(k)}(z)`\ , where :math:`k` is 1 or 2, :math:`H_ν^{(k)}(z)` is ``besselh(nu, k, z)``\ , and :math:`∓` is :math:`-` for :math:`k=1` and :math:`+` for :math:`k=2`\ .  ``k`` defaults to 1 if it is omitted.

   The reason for this function is that :math:`H_ν^{(k)}(z)` is asymptotically proportional to :math:`\exp(∓iz)/\sqrt{z}` for large :math:`|z|`\ , and so the :func:`besselh` function is susceptible to overflow or underflow when ``z`` has a large imaginary part.  The ``besselhx`` function cancels this exponential factor (analytically), so it avoids these problems.

For :math:`z=1`\ , it yields the Riemann zeta function :math:`\zeta(s)`\ .

This macro expands to efficient inline code that uses either Horner's method or, for complex ``z``\ , a more efficient Goertzel-like algorithm.

Statistics
----------

.. function:: mean(v[, region])

   .. Docstring generated from Julia source

   Compute the mean of whole array ``v``\ , or optionally along the dimensions in ``region``\ .

   .. note::
      Julia does not ignore ``NaN`` values in the computation. For applications requiring the handling of missing data, the ``DataArrays.jl`` package is recommended.


.. function:: mean(f::Function, v)

   .. Docstring generated from Julia source

   Apply the function ``f`` to each element of ``v`` and take the mean.

.. function:: mean!(r, v)

   .. Docstring generated from Julia source

.. function:: std(v[, region]; corrected::Bool=true, mean=nothing)

   .. Docstring generated from Julia source

   Compute the sample standard deviation of a vector or array ``v``\ , optionally along dimensions in ``region``\ . The algorithm returns an estimator of the generative distribution's standard deviation under the assumption that each entry of ``v`` is an IID drawn from that generative distribution. This computation is equivalent to calculating ``sqrt(sum((v - mean(v)).^2) / (length(v) - 1))``\ . A pre-computed ``mean`` may be provided. If ``corrected`` is ``true``\ , then the sum is scaled with ``n-1``\ , whereas the sum is scaled with ``n`` if ``corrected`` is ``false`` where ``n = length(x)``\ .

   .. note::
      Julia does not ignore ``NaN`` values in the computation. For applications requiring the handling of missing data, the ``DataArrays.jl`` package is recommended.

   .. Docstring generated from Julia source

   Compute the sample standard deviation of a vector ``v`` with known mean ``m``\ . If ``corrected`` is ``true``\ , then the sum is scaled with ``n-1``\ , whereas the sum is scaled with ``n`` if ``corrected`` is ``false`` where ``n = length(x)``\ .

   .. note::
      Julia does not ignore ``NaN`` values in the computation. For applications requiring the handling of missing data, the ``DataArrays.jl`` package is recommended.


.. function:: var(v[, region]; corrected::Bool=true, mean=nothing)

   .. Docstring generated from Julia source

   Compute the sample variance of a vector or array ``v``\ , optionally along dimensions in ``region``\ . The algorithm will return an estimator of the generative distribution's variance under the assumption that each entry of ``v`` is an IID drawn from that generative distribution. This computation is equivalent to calculating ``sumabs2(v - mean(v)) / (length(v) - 1)``\ . If ``corrected`` is ``true``\ , then the sum is scaled with ``n-1``\ , whereas the sum is scaled with ``n`` if ``corrected`` is ``false`` where ``n = length(x)``\ . The mean ``mean`` over the region may be provided.

   .. note::
      Julia does not ignore ``NaN`` values in the computation. For applications requiring the handling of missing data, the ``DataArrays.jl`` package is recommended.


.. function:: varm(v, m[, region]; corrected::Bool=true)

   .. Docstring generated from Julia source

   Compute the sample variance of a collection ``v`` with known mean(s) ``m``\ , optionally over ``region``\ . ``m`` may contain means for each dimension of ``v``\ . If ``corrected`` is ``true``\ , then the sum is scaled with ``n-1``\ , whereas the sum is scaled with ``n`` if ``corrected`` is ``false`` where ``n = length(x)``\ .

   .. note::
      Julia does not ignore ``NaN`` values in the computation. For applications requiring the handling of missing data, the ``DataArrays.jl`` package is recommended.

.. function:: middle(x, y)

   .. Docstring generated from Julia source

   Compute the middle of two reals ``x`` and ``y``\ , which is equivalent in both value and type to computing their mean (``(x + y) / 2``\ ).

.. function:: middle(range)

   .. Docstring generated from Julia source

   Compute the middle of a range, which consists of computing the mean of its extrema. Since a range is sorted, the mean is performed with the first and last element.

   .. doctest::

       julia> middle(1:10)
       5.5

.. function:: middle(a)

   .. Docstring generated from Julia source

   Compute the middle of an array ``a``\ , which consists of finding its extrema and then computing their mean.

         3.6
        10.9

       julia> middle(a)
       5.95

.. function:: median(v[, region])

   .. Docstring generated from Julia source

   Compute the median of an entire array ``v``\ , or, optionally, along the dimensions in ``region``\ . For an even number of elements no exact median element exists, so the result is equivalent to calculating mean of two median elements.

   .. note::
      Julia does not ignore ``NaN`` values in the computation. For applications requiring the handling of missing data, the ``DataArrays.jl`` package is recommended.


.. function:: median!(v)

   .. Docstring generated from Julia source

   Like :func:`median`\ , but may overwrite the input vector.

.. function:: midpoints(e)

   .. Docstring generated from Julia source

   Compute the midpoints of the bins with edges ``e``\ . The result is a vector/range of length ``length(e) - 1``\ . Note: Julia does not ignore ``NaN`` values in the computation.

.. function:: quantile(v, p; sorted=false)

   .. Docstring generated from Julia source

   Compute the quantile(s) of a vector ``v`` at a specified probability or vector ``p``\ . The keyword argument ``sorted`` indicates whether ``v`` can be assumed to be sorted.

   The ``p`` should be on the interval [0,1], and ``v`` should not have any ``NaN`` values.

   Quantiles are computed via linear interpolation between the points ``((k-1)/(n-1), v[k])``\ , for ``k = 1:n`` where ``n = length(v)``\ . This corresponds to Definition 7 of Hyndman and Fan (1996), and is the same as the R default.

   .. note::
      Julia does not ignore ``NaN`` values in the computation. For applications requiring the handling of missing data, the ``DataArrays.jl`` package is recommended. ``quantile`` will throw an ``ArgumentError`` in the presence of ``NaN`` values in the data array.

.. function:: quantile!([q, ] v, p; sorted=false)

   .. Docstring generated from Julia source

   Compute the quantile(s) of a vector ``v`` at the probabilities ``p``\ , with optional output into array ``q`` (if not provided, a new output array is created). The keyword argument ``sorted`` indicates whether ``v`` can be assumed to be sorted; if ``false`` (the default), then the elements of ``v`` may be partially sorted.

   The elements of ``p`` should be on the interval [0,1], and ``v`` should not have any ``NaN`` values.

   Quantiles are computed via linear interpolation between the points ``((k-1)/(n-1), v[k])``\ , for ``k = 1:n`` where ``n = length(v)``\ . This corresponds to Definition 7 of Hyndman and Fan (1996), and is the same as the R default.

.. function:: cov(X[, vardim=1, corrected=true])

   .. Docstring generated from Julia source

Signal Processing
-----------------

Fast Fourier transform (FFT) functions in Julia are
implemented by calling functions from `FFTW
<http://www.fftw.org>`_.

.. function:: fft(A [, dims])

   .. Docstring generated from Julia source

   Performs a multidimensional FFT of the array ``A``\ . The optional ``dims`` argument specifies an iterable subset of dimensions (e.g. an integer, range, tuple, or array) to transform along. Most efficient if the size of ``A`` along the transformed dimensions is a product of small primes; see ``nextprod()``\ . See also ``plan_fft()`` for even greater efficiency.

   A one-dimensional FFT computes the one-dimensional discrete Fourier transform (DFT) as defined by

   .. math::

       \operatorname{DFT}(A)[k] =
         \sum_{n=1}^{\operatorname{length}(A)}
         \exp\left(-i\frac{2\pi
         (n-1)(k-1)}{\operatorname{length}(A)} \right) A[n].

   A multidimensional FFT simply performs this operation along each transformed dimension of ``A``\ .

   .. note::
      * Julia starts FFTW up with 1 thread by default. Higher performance is usually possible by increasing number of threads. Use ``FFTW.set_num_threads(Sys.CPU_CORES)`` to use as many threads as cores on your system.
      * This performs a multidimensional FFT by default. FFT libraries in other languages such as Python and Octave perform a one-dimensional FFT along the first non-singleton dimension of the array. This is worth noting while performing comparisons. For more details, refer to the :ref:`man-noteworthy-differences` section of the manual.


.. function:: fft!(A [, dims])

   .. Docstring generated from Julia source

   Same as :func:`fft`\ , but operates in-place on ``A``\ , which must be an array of complex floating-point numbers.

.. function:: ifft(A [, dims])

   .. Docstring generated from Julia source

   Multidimensional inverse FFT.

   A one-dimensional inverse FFT computes

   .. math::

       \operatorname{IDFT}(A)[k] = \frac{1}{\operatorname{length}(A)}
       \sum_{n=1}^{\operatorname{length}(A)} \exp\left(+i\frac{2\pi (n-1)(k-1)}
       {\operatorname{length}(A)} \right) A[n].

   A multidimensional inverse FFT simply performs this operation along each transformed dimension of ``A``\ .

.. function:: ifft!(A [, dims])

   .. Docstring generated from Julia source

   Same as :func:`ifft`\ , but operates in-place on ``A``\ .

.. function:: bfft(A [, dims])

   .. Docstring generated from Julia source

   Similar to :func:`ifft`\ , but computes an unnormalized inverse (backward) transform, which must be divided by the product of the sizes of the transformed dimensions in order to obtain the inverse. (This is slightly more efficient than :func:`ifft` because it omits a scaling step, which in some applications can be combined with other computational steps elsewhere.)

   .. math::

       \operatorname{BDFT}(A)[k] = \operatorname{length}(A) \operatorname{IDFT}(A)[k]

.. function:: bfft!(A [, dims])

   .. Docstring generated from Julia source

   Same as :func:`bfft`\ , but operates in-place on ``A``\ .

.. function:: plan_fft(A [, dims]; flags=FFTW.ESTIMATE;  timelimit=Inf)

   .. Docstring generated from Julia source

   Pre-plan an optimized FFT along given dimensions (``dims``\ ) of arrays matching the shape and type of ``A``\ .  (The first two arguments have the same meaning as for :func:`fft`\ .) Returns an object ``P`` which represents the linear operator computed by the FFT, and which contains all of the information needed to compute ``fft(A, dims)`` quickly.

   To apply ``P`` to an array ``A``\ , use ``P * A``\ ; in general, the syntax for applying plans is much like that of matrices.  (A plan can only be applied to arrays of the same size as the ``A`` for which the plan was created.)  You can also apply a plan with a preallocated output array ``Â`` by calling ``A_mul_B!(Â, plan, A)``\ .  (For ``A_mul_B!``\ , however, the input array ``A`` must be a complex floating-point array like the output ``Â``\ .) You can compute the inverse-transform plan by ``inv(P)`` and apply the inverse plan with ``P \ Â`` (the inverse plan is cached and reused for subsequent calls to ``inv`` or ``\``\ ), and apply the inverse plan to a pre-allocated output array ``A`` with ``A_ldiv_B!(A, P, Â)``\ .

   The ``flags`` argument is a bitwise-or of FFTW planner flags, defaulting to ``FFTW.ESTIMATE``\ . e.g. passing ``FFTW.MEASURE`` or ``FFTW.PATIENT`` will instead spend several seconds (or more) benchmarking different possible FFT algorithms and picking the fastest one; see the FFTW manual for more information on planner flags.  The optional ``timelimit`` argument specifies a rough upper bound on the allowed planning time, in seconds. Passing ``FFTW.MEASURE`` or ``FFTW.PATIENT`` may cause the input array ``A`` to be overwritten with zeros during plan creation.

   :func:`plan_fft!` is the same as :func:`plan_fft` but creates a plan that operates in-place on its argument (which must be an array of complex floating-point numbers). :func:`plan_ifft` and so on are similar but produce plans that perform the equivalent of the inverse transforms :func:`ifft` and so on.

.. function:: plan_ifft(A [, dims]; flags=FFTW.ESTIMATE;  timelimit=Inf)

   .. Docstring generated from Julia source

   Same as :func:`plan_fft`\ , but produces a plan that performs inverse transforms :func:`ifft`\ .

.. function:: plan_bfft(A [, dims]; flags=FFTW.ESTIMATE;  timelimit=Inf)

   .. Docstring generated from Julia source

   Same as :func:`plan_fft`\ , but produces a plan that performs an unnormalized backwards transform :func:`bfft`\ .

.. function:: plan_fft!(A [, dims]; flags=FFTW.ESTIMATE;  timelimit=Inf)

   .. Docstring generated from Julia source

   Same as :func:`plan_fft`\ , but operates in-place on ``A``\ .

.. function:: plan_ifft!(A [, dims]; flags=FFTW.ESTIMATE;  timelimit=Inf)

   .. Docstring generated from Julia source

   Same as :func:`plan_ifft`\ , but operates in-place on ``A``\ .

.. function:: plan_bfft!(A [, dims]; flags=FFTW.ESTIMATE;  timelimit=Inf)

   .. Docstring generated from Julia source

   Same as :func:`plan_bfft`\ , but operates in-place on ``A``\ .

.. function:: rfft(A [, dims])

   .. Docstring generated from Julia source

   Multidimensional FFT of a real array ``A``\ , exploiting the fact that the transform has conjugate symmetry in order to save roughly half the computational time and storage costs compared with :func:`fft`\ . If ``A`` has size ``(n_1, ..., n_d)``\ , the result has size ``(div(n_1,2)+1, ..., n_d)``\ .

   The optional ``dims`` argument specifies an iterable subset of one or more dimensions of ``A`` to transform, similar to :func:`fft`\ . Instead of (roughly) halving the first dimension of ``A`` in the result, the ``dims[1]`` dimension is (roughly) halved in the same way.

.. function:: irfft(A, d [, dims])

   .. Docstring generated from Julia source

   Inverse of :func:`rfft`\ : for a complex array ``A``\ , gives the corresponding real array whose FFT yields ``A`` in the first half. As for :func:`rfft`\ , ``dims`` is an optional subset of dimensions to transform, defaulting to ``1:ndims(A)``\ .

   ``d`` is the length of the transformed real array along the ``dims[1]`` dimension, which must satisfy ``div(d,2)+1 == size(A,dims[1])``\ . (This parameter cannot be inferred from ``size(A)`` since both ``2*size(A,dims[1])-2`` as well as ``2*size(A,dims[1])-1`` are valid sizes for the transformed real array.)

.. function:: brfft(A, d [, dims])

   .. Docstring generated from Julia source

   Similar to :func:`irfft` but computes an unnormalized inverse transform (similar to :func:`bfft`\ ), which must be divided by the product of the sizes of the transformed dimensions (of the real output array) in order to obtain the inverse transform.

.. function:: plan_rfft(A [, dims]; flags=FFTW.ESTIMATE;  timelimit=Inf)

   .. Docstring generated from Julia source

   Pre-plan an optimized real-input FFT, similar to :func:`plan_fft` except for :func:`rfft` instead of :func:`fft`\ . The first two arguments, and the size of the transformed result, are the same as for :func:`rfft`\ .

.. function:: r2r(A, kind [, dims])

   .. Docstring generated from Julia source

   Performs a multidimensional real-input/real-output (r2r) transform of type ``kind`` of the array ``A``\ , as defined in the FFTW manual. ``kind`` specifies either a discrete cosine transform of various types (``FFTW.REDFT00``\ , ``FFTW.REDFT01``\ , ``FFTW.REDFT10``\ , or ``FFTW.REDFT11``\ ), a discrete sine transform of various types (``FFTW.RODFT00``\ , ``FFTW.RODFT01``\ , ``FFTW.RODFT10``\ , or ``FFTW.RODFT11``\ ), a real-input DFT with halfcomplex-format output (``FFTW.R2HC`` and its inverse ``FFTW.HC2R``\ ), or a discrete Hartley transform (``FFTW.DHT``\ ).  The ``kind`` argument may be an array or tuple in order to specify different transform types along the different dimensions of ``A``\ ; ``kind[end]`` is used for any unspecified dimensions.  See the FFTW manual for precise definitions of these transform types, at http://www.fftw.org/doc.

   The optional ``dims`` argument specifies an iterable subset of dimensions (e.g. an integer, range, tuple, or array) to transform along. ``kind[i]`` is then the transform type for ``dims[i]``\ , with ``kind[end]`` being used for ``i > length(kind)``\ .

Numerical Integration
---------------------

Although several external packages are available for numeric integration
and solution of ordinary differential equations, we also provide
some built-in integration support in Julia.

.. function:: quadgk(f, a,b,c...; reltol=sqrt(eps), abstol=0, maxevals=10^7, order=7, norm=vecnorm)

   .. Docstring generated from Julia source

   Numerically integrate the function ``f(x)`` from ``a`` to ``b``\ , and optionally over additional intervals ``b`` to ``c`` and so on. Keyword options include a relative error tolerance ``reltol`` (defaults to ``sqrt(eps)`` in the precision of the endpoints), an absolute error tolerance ``abstol`` (defaults to 0), a maximum number of function evaluations ``maxevals`` (defaults to ``10^7``\ ), and the ``order`` of the integration rule (defaults to 7).

   Returns a pair ``(I,E)`` of the estimated integral ``I`` and an estimated upper bound on the absolute error ``E``\ . If ``maxevals`` is not exceeded then ``E <= max(abstol, reltol*norm(I))`` will hold. (Note that it is useful to specify a positive ``abstol`` in cases where ``norm(I)`` may be zero.)

   The endpoints ``a`` et cetera can also be complex (in which case the integral is performed over straight-line segments in the complex plane). If the endpoints are ``BigFloat``\ , then the integration will be performed in ``BigFloat`` precision as well.

   .. note::
      It is advisable to increase the integration ``order`` in rough proportion to the precision, for smooth integrands.


   More generally, the precision is set by the precision of the integration endpoints (promoted to floating-point types).

   The integrand ``f(x)`` can return any numeric scalar, vector, or matrix type, or in fact any type supporting ``+``\ , ``-``\ , multiplication by real values, and a ``norm`` (i.e., any normed vector space). Alternatively, a different norm can be specified by passing a ``norm``\ -like function as the ``norm`` keyword argument (which defaults to ``vecnorm``\ ).

   .. note::
      Only one-dimensional integrals are provided by this function. For multi-dimensional integration (cubature), there are many different algorithms (often much better than simple nested 1d integrals) and the optimal choice tends to be very problem-dependent. See the Julia external-package listing for available algorithms for multidimensional integration or other specialized tasks (such as integrals of highly oscillatory or singular functions).


   The algorithm is an adaptive Gauss-Kronrod integration technique: the integral in each interval is estimated using a Kronrod rule (``2*order+1`` points) and the error is estimated using an embedded Gauss rule (``order`` points). The interval with the largest error is then subdivided into two intervals and the process is repeated until the desired error tolerance is achieved.

   These quadrature rules work best for smooth functions within each interval, so if your function has a known discontinuity or other singularity, it is best to subdivide your interval to put the singularity at an endpoint. For example, if ``f`` has a discontinuity at ``x=0.7`` and you want to integrate from 0 to 1, you should use ``quadgk(f, 0,0.7,1)`` to subdivide the interval at the point of discontinuity. The integrand is never evaluated exactly at the endpoints of the intervals, so it is possible to integrate functions that diverge at the endpoints as long as the singularity is integrable (for example, a ``log(x)`` or ``1/sqrt(x)`` singularity).

   For real-valued endpoints, the starting and/or ending points may be infinite. (A coordinate transformation is performed internally to map the infinite interval to a finite one.)
