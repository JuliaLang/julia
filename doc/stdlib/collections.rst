Iteration
---------

Sequential iteration is implemented by the methods :func:`start`, :func:`done`, and
:func:`next`. The general ``for`` loop::

    for i = I   # or  "for i in I"
      # body
    end

is translated into::

    state = start(I)
    while !done(I, state)
      (i, state) = next(I, state)
      # body
    end

The ``state`` object may be anything, and should be chosen appropriately for each iterable type.

.. function:: start(iter) -> state

   Get initial iteration state for an iterable object


.. function:: done(iter, state) -> Bool

   Test whether we are done iterating


.. function:: next(iter, state) -> item, state

   For a given iterable object and iteration state, return the current item and the next iteration state


.. function:: zip(iters...)

   For a set of iterable objects, returns an iterable of tuples, where the "i"th tuple contains the "i"th component of each input iterable.

   Note that "zip()" is its own inverse: "collect(zip(zip(a...)...)) == collect(a)".


.. function:: enumerate(iter)

   An iterator that yields "(i, x)" where "i" is an index starting at 1, and "x" is the "i"th value from the given iterator. It's useful when you need not only the values "x" over which you are iterating, but also the index "i" of the iterations.

   ::

       julia> a = ["a", "b", "c"];

       julia> for (index, value) in enumerate(a)
                  println("\$index \$value")
              end
       1 a
       2 b
       3 c


.. function:: rest(iter, state)

   An iterator that yields the same elements as "iter", but starting at the given "state".


.. function:: countfrom(start=1, step=1)

   An iterator that counts forever, starting at "start" and incrementing by "step".


.. function:: take(iter, n)

   An iterator that generates at most the first "n" elements of "iter".


.. function:: drop(iter, n)

   An iterator that generates all but the first "n" elements of "iter".


.. function:: cycle(iter)

   An iterator that cycles through "iter" forever.


.. function:: repeated(x[, n::Int])

   An iterator that generates the value "x" forever. If "n" is specified, generates "x" that many times (equivalent to "take(repeated(x), n)").

General Collections
-------------------

.. function:: isempty(collection) -> Bool

   Determine whether a collection is empty (has no elements).

       false

Iterable Collections
--------------------

.. function:: in(item, collection) -> Bool

   ∈(item, collection) -> Bool ∋(collection, item) -> Bool ∉(item, collection) -> Bool ∌(collection, item) -> Bool

   Determine whether an item is in the given collection, in the sense that it is "==" to one of the values generated by iterating over the collection. Some collections need a slightly different definition; for example "Set"s check whether the item "isequal()" to one of the elements. "Dict"s look for "(key,value)" pairs, and the key is compared using "isequal()". To test for the presence of a key in a dictionary, use "haskey()" or "k in keys(dict)".


.. function:: eltype(type)

   Determine the type of the elements generated by iterating a collection of the given "type". For associative collection types, this will be a "(key,value)" tuple type. The definition "eltype(x) = eltype(typeof(x))" is provided for convenience so that instances can be passed instead of types. However the form that accepts a type argument should be defined for new types.


.. function:: indexin(a, b)

   Returns a vector containing the highest index in "b" for each value in "a" that is a member of "b" . The output vector contains 0 wherever "a" is not a member of "b".


.. function:: findin(a, b)

   Returns the indices of elements in collection "a" that appear in collection "b"


.. function:: unique(itr[, dim])

   Returns an array containing only the unique elements of the iterable "itr", in the order that the first of each set of equivalent elements originally appears. If "dim" is specified, returns unique regions of the array "itr" along "dim".


.. function:: reduce(op, v0, itr)

   Reduce the given collection "ìtr" with the given binary operator "op". "v0" must be a neutral element for "op" that will be returned for empty collections. It is unspecified whether "v0" is used for non-empty collections.

   Reductions for certain commonly-used operators have special implementations which should be used instead: "maximum(itr)", "minimum(itr)", "sum(itr)", "prod(itr)", "any(itr)", "all(itr)".

   The associativity of the reduction is implementation dependent. This means that you can't use non-associative operations like "-" because it is undefined whether "reduce(-,[1,2,3])" should be evaluated as "(1-2)-3" or "1-(2-3)". Use "foldl" or "foldr" instead for guaranteed left or right associativity.

   Some operations accumulate error, and parallelism will also be easier if the reduction can be executed in groups. Future versions of Julia might change the algorithm. Note that the elements are not reordered if you use an ordered collection.

   ::

       reduce(op, itr)

   Like "reduce(op, v0, itr)". This cannot be used with empty collections, except for some special cases (e.g. when "op" is one of "+", "*", "max", "min", "&", "|") when Julia can determine the neutral element of "op".


.. function:: reduce(op, v0, itr)

   Reduce the given collection "ìtr" with the given binary operator "op". "v0" must be a neutral element for "op" that will be returned for empty collections. It is unspecified whether "v0" is used for non-empty collections.

Indexable Collections
---------------------

Associative Collections
-----------------------

:obj:`Dict` is the standard associative collection. Its implementation uses :func:`hash` as the hashing function for the key, and :func:`isequal` to determine equality. Define these two functions for custom types to override how they are stored in a hash table.

:obj:`ObjectIdDict` is a special hash table where the keys are always object identities.

:obj:`WeakKeyDict` is a hash table implementation where the keys are weak references to objects, and thus may be garbage collected even when referenced in a hash table.

:obj:`Dict`\ s can be created by passing pair objects constructed with :func:`=>` to a :obj:`Dict` constructor: ``Dict("A"=>1, "B"=>2)``. This call will attempt to infer type information from the keys and values (i.e. this example creates a ``Dict{ASCIIString, Int64}``).
To explicitly specify types use the syntax ``Dict{KeyType,ValueType}(...)``.
For example, ``Dict{ASCIIString,Int32}("A"=>1, "B"=>2)``.

As with :obj:`Array`\ s, :obj:`Dict`\ s may be created with comprehensions. For example,
``[i => f(i) for i = 1:10]``.

Given a dictionary ``D``, the syntax ``D[x]`` returns the value of key ``x`` (if it exists) or throws an error, and ``D[x] = y`` stores the key-value pair ``x => y`` in ``D`` (replacing any existing value for the key ``x``).  Multiple arguments to ``D[...]`` are converted to tuples; for example, the syntax ``D[x,y]``  is equivalent to ``D[(x,y)]``, i.e. it refers to the value keyed by the tuple ``(x,y)``.

.. function:: Dict([itr])

   "Dict{K,V}()" constructs a hash table with keys of type "K" and values of type "V".

   Given a single iterable argument, constructs a "Dict" whose key- value pairs are taken from 2-tuples "(key,value)" generated by the argument.

   ::

       julia> Dict([("A", 1), ("B", 2)])
       Dict{ASCIIString,Int64} with 2 entries:
         "B" => 2
         "A" => 1

   Alternatively, a sequence of pair arguments may be passed.

   ::

       julia> Dict("A"=>1, "B"=>2)
       Dict{ASCIIString,Int64} with 2 entries:
         "B" => 2
         "A" => 1

.. function:: IntSet([itr])

   Construct a sorted set of the integers generated by the given iterable object, or an empty set. Implemented as a bit string, and therefore designed for dense integer sets. Only non-negative integers can be stored. If the set will be sparse (for example holding a single very large integer), use "Set" instead.


.. function:: union(s1, s2...)

   ∪(s1, s2)

   Construct the union of two or more sets. Maintains order with arrays.

.. function:: setdiff(s1, s2)

   Construct the set of elements in "s1" but not "s2". Maintains order with arrays. Note that both arguments must be collections, and both will be iterated over. In particular, "setdiff(set,element)" where "element" is a potential member of "set", will not work in general.


.. function:: setdiff!(s, iterable)

   Remove each element of "iterable" from set "s" in-place.


.. function:: symdiff(s1, s2...)

   Construct the symmetric difference of elements in the passed in sets or arrays. Maintains order with arrays.

.. function:: complement(s)

   Returns the set-complement of "IntSet" "s".


.. function:: complement!(s)

   Mutates "IntSet" "s" into its set-complement.


.. function:: intersect!(s1, s2)

   Intersects sets "s1" and "s2" and overwrites the set "s1" with the result. If needed, "s1" will be expanded to the size of "s2".


.. function:: issubset(a, b)

   ⊆(A, S) -> Bool ⊈(A, S) -> Bool ⊊(A, S) -> Bool

   Determine whether every element of "a" is also in "b", using "in()".

   ::

       issubset(A, S) -> Bool

   ⊆(A, S) -> Bool

   True if A is a subset of or equal to S.

PriorityQueue
-------------

The :obj:`PriorityQueue` type is available from the :mod:`Collections` module. It provides
a basic priority queue implementation allowing for arbitrary key and priority types.
Multiple identical keys are not permitted, but the priority of existing keys can be
changed efficiently.

.. function:: PriorityQueue(K, V[, ord])

   Construct a new "PriorityQueue", with keys of type "K" and values/priorites of type "V". If an order is not given, the priority queue is min-ordered using the default comparison for "V".


.. function:: enqueue!(pq, k, v)

   Insert the a key "k" into a priority queue "pq" with priority "v".


.. function:: dequeue!(pq)

   Remove and return the lowest priority key from a priority queue.


.. function:: peek(pq)

   Return the lowest priority key from a priority queue without removing that key from the queue.


:obj:`PriorityQueue` also behaves similarly to a :obj:`Dict` in that keys can be
inserted and priorities accessed or changed using indexing notation.

  .. doctest::

    julia> # Julia code
           pq = Collections.PriorityQueue();

    julia> # Insert keys with associated priorities

Heap Functions
--------------

Along with the :obj:`PriorityQueue` type, the :mod:`Collections` module provides
lower level functions for performing binary heap operations on arrays. Each
function takes an optional ordering argument. If not given, default ordering
is used, so that elements popped from the heap are given in ascending order.

.. function:: heapify(v[, ord])

   Return a new vector in binary heap order, optionally using the given ordering.


.. function:: heapify!(v[, ord])

   In-place "heapify()".


.. function:: isheap(v[, ord])

   Return true iff an array is heap-ordered according to the given order.


.. function:: heappush!(v, x[, ord])

   Given a binary heap-ordered array, push a new element "x", preserving the heap property. For efficiency, this function does not check that the array is indeed heap-ordered.


.. function:: heappop!(v[, ord])

   Given a binary heap-ordered array, remove and return the lowest ordered element. For efficiency, this function does not check that the array is indeed heap-ordered.
