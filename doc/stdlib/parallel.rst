 Tasks and Parallel Computing
******************************

Tasks
-----

.. function:: Task(func)

   Create a ``Task`` (i.e. thread, or coroutine) to execute the given function (which must be callable with no arguments). The task exits when this function returns.

.. function:: yieldto(task, args...)

   Switch to the given task. The first time a task is switched to, the task's function is called with no arguments. On subsequent switches, ``args`` are returned from the task's last call to ``yieldto``. This is a low-level call that only switches tasks, not considering states or scheduling in any way.

.. function:: current_task()

   Get the currently running Task.

.. function:: istaskdone(task) -> Bool

   Tell whether a task has exited.

.. function:: consume(task, values...)

   Receive the next value passed to ``produce`` by the specified task.
   Additional arguments may be passed, to be returned from the last ``produce`` call
   in the producer.

.. function:: produce(value)

   Send the given value to the last ``consume`` call, switching to the consumer task.
   If the next ``consume`` call passes any values, they are returned by ``produce``.

.. function:: yield()

   Switch to the scheduler to allow another scheduled task to run. A task that calls this function is still runnable, and will be restarted immediately if there are no other runnable tasks.

.. function:: task_local_storage(symbol)

   Look up the value of a symbol in the current task's task-local storage.

.. function:: task_local_storage(symbol, value)

   Assign a value to a symbol in the current task's task-local storage.

.. function:: task_local_storage(body, symbol, value)

   Call the function ``body`` with a modified task-local storage, in which
   ``value`` is assigned to ``symbol``; the previous value of ``symbol``, or
   lack thereof, is restored afterwards. Useful for emulating dynamic scoping.

.. function:: Condition()

   Create an edge-triggered event source that tasks can wait for. Tasks
   that call ``wait`` on a ``Condition`` are suspended and queued.
   Tasks are woken up when ``notify`` is later called on the ``Condition``.
   Edge triggering means that only tasks waiting at the time ``notify`` is
   called can be woken up. For level-triggered notifications, you must
   keep extra state to keep track of whether a notification has happened.
   The ``RemoteRef`` type does this, and so can be used for level-triggered
   events.

.. function:: notify(condition, val=nothing; all=true, error=false)

   Wake up tasks waiting for a condition, passing them ``val``.
   If ``all`` is true (the default), all waiting tasks are woken, otherwise
   only one is. If ``error`` is true, the passed value is raised as an
   exception in the woken tasks.

.. function:: schedule(t::Task, [val]; error=false)

   Add a task to the scheduler's queue. This causes the task to run constantly
   when the system is otherwise idle, unless the task performs a blocking
   operation such as ``wait``.

   If a second argument is provided, it will be passed to the task (via the
   return value of ``yieldto``) when it runs again. If ``error`` is true,
   the value is raised as an exception in the woken task.

.. function:: @schedule

   Wrap an expression in a Task and add it to the scheduler's queue.

.. function:: @task

   Wrap an expression in a Task executing it, and return the Task. This
   only creates a task, and does not run it.

.. function:: sleep(seconds)

   Block the current task for a specified number of seconds. The minimum sleep
   time is 1 millisecond or input of ``0.001``.


General Parallel Computing Support
----------------------------------

.. function:: addprocs(n::Integer; exeflags=``) -> List of process identifiers

   Launches workers using the in-built ``LocalManager`` which only launches workers on the local host.
   This can be used to take advantage of multiple cores. ``addprocs(4)`` will add 4 processes on the local machine.

.. function:: addprocs() -> List of process identifiers

    Equivalent to ``addprocs(CPU_CORES)``

.. function:: addprocs(machines; tunnel=false, sshflags=``, max_parallel=10, exeflags=``) -> List of process identifiers

   Add processes on remote machines via SSH.
   Requires julia to be installed in the same location on each node, or to be available via a shared file system.

   ``machines`` is a vector of machine specifications.  Worker are started for each specification.

   A machine specification is either a string ``machine_spec`` or a tuple - ``(machine_spec, count)``

   ``machine_spec`` is a string of the form ``[user@]host[:port] [bind_addr[:port]]``. ``user`` defaults
   to current user, ``port`` to the standard ssh port. If ``[bind_addr[:port]]`` is specified, other
   workers will connect to this worker at the specified ``bind_addr`` and ``port``.

   ``count`` is the number of workers to be launched on the specified host. If specified as ``:auto``
   it will launch as many workers as the number of cores on the specific host.


   Keyword arguments:

   ``tunnel`` : if ``true`` then SSH tunneling will be used to connect to the worker from the master process.

   ``sshflags`` : specifies additional ssh options, e.g. :literal:`sshflags=\`-i /home/foo/bar.pem\`` .

   ``max_parallel`` : specifies the maximum number of workers connected to in parallel at a host. Defaults to 10.

   ``dir`` :  specifies the location of the julia binaries on the worker nodes. Defaults to JULIA_HOME.

   ``exename`` :  name of the julia executable. Defaults to "./julia" or "./julia-debug" as the case may be.

   ``exeflags`` :  additional flags passed to the worker processes.


.. function:: addprocs(manager::ClusterManager; kwargs...) -> List of process identifiers

   Launches worker processes via the specified cluster manager.

   For example Beowulf clusters are  supported via a custom cluster manager implemented
   in  package ``ClusterManagers``.


.. function:: nprocs()

   Get the number of available processes.

.. function:: nworkers()

   Get the number of available worker processes. This is one less than nprocs(). Equal to nprocs() if nprocs() == 1.

.. function:: procs()

   Returns a list of all process identifiers.

.. function:: workers()

   Returns a list of all worker process identifiers.

.. function:: rmprocs(pids...)

   Removes the specified workers.

.. function:: interrupt([pids...])

   Interrupt the current executing task on the specified workers. This is
   equivalent to pressing Ctrl-C on the local machine. If no arguments are given,
   all workers are interrupted.

.. function:: myid()

   Get the id of the current process.

.. function:: pmap(f, lsts...; err_retry=true, err_stop=false, pids=workers())

   Transform collections ``lsts`` by applying ``f`` to each element in parallel.
   If ``nprocs() > 1``, the calling process will be dedicated to assigning tasks.
   All other available processes will be used as parallel workers, or on the processes specified by ``pids``.

   If ``err_retry`` is true, it retries a failed application of ``f`` on a different worker.
   If ``err_stop`` is true, it takes precedence over the value of ``err_retry`` and ``pmap`` stops execution on the first error.


.. function:: remotecall(id, func, args...)

   Call a function asynchronously on the given arguments on the specified process. Returns a ``RemoteRef``.

.. function:: wait([x])

   Block the current task until some event occurs, depending on the type
   of the argument:

   * ``RemoteRef``: Wait for a value to become available for the specified remote reference.

   * ``Condition``: Wait for ``notify`` on a condition.

   * ``Process``: Wait for a process or process chain to exit. The ``exitcode`` field of a process can be used to determine success or failure.

   * ``Task``: Wait for a ``Task`` to finish, returning its result value.

   * ``RawFD``: Wait for changes on a file descriptor (see `poll_fd` for keyword arguments and return code)

   If no argument is passed, the task blocks for an undefined period. If the task's
   state is set to ``:waiting``, it can only be restarted by an explicit call to
   ``schedule`` or ``yieldto``. If the task's state is ``:runnable``, it might be
   restarted unpredictably.

   Often ``wait`` is called within a ``while`` loop to ensure a waited-for condition
   is met before proceeding.

.. function:: fetch(RemoteRef)

   Wait for and get the value of a remote reference.

.. function:: remotecall_wait(id, func, args...)

   Perform ``wait(remotecall(...))`` in one message.

.. function:: remotecall_fetch(id, func, args...)

   Perform ``fetch(remotecall(...))`` in one message.

.. function:: put!(RemoteRef, value)

   Store a value to a remote reference. Implements "shared queue of length 1" semantics: if a value is already present, blocks until the value is removed with ``take!``. Returns its first argument.

.. function:: take!(RemoteRef)

   Fetch the value of a remote reference, removing it so that the reference is empty again.

.. function:: isready(r::RemoteRef)

   Determine whether a ``RemoteRef`` has a value stored to it. Note that this function
   can cause race conditions, since by the time you receive its result it may
   no longer be true. It is recommended that this function only be used on a
   ``RemoteRef`` that is assigned once.

   If the argument ``RemoteRef`` is owned by a different node, this call will block to
   wait for the answer. It is recommended to wait for ``r`` in a separate task instead,
   or to use a local ``RemoteRef`` as a proxy::

       rr = RemoteRef()
       @async put!(rr, remotecall_fetch(p, long_computation))
       isready(rr)  # will not block

.. function:: RemoteRef()

   Make an uninitialized remote reference on the local machine.

.. function:: RemoteRef(n)

   Make an uninitialized remote reference on process ``n``.

.. function:: timedwait(testcb::Function, secs::Float64; pollint::Float64=0.1)

   Waits till ``testcb`` returns ``true`` or for ``secs``` seconds, whichever is earlier.
   ``testcb`` is polled every ``pollint`` seconds.

.. function:: @spawn

   Execute an expression on an automatically-chosen process, returning a
   ``RemoteRef`` to the result.

.. function:: @spawnat

   Accepts two arguments, ``p`` and an expression, and runs the expression
   asynchronously on process ``p``, returning a ``RemoteRef`` to the result.

.. function:: @fetch

   Equivalent to ``fetch(@spawn expr)``.

.. function:: @fetchfrom

   Equivalent to ``fetch(@spawnat p expr)``.

.. function:: @async

   Schedule an expression to run on the local machine, also adding it to the
   set of items that the nearest enclosing ``@sync`` waits for.

.. function:: @sync

   Wait until all dynamically-enclosed uses of ``@async``, ``@spawn``,
   ``@spawnat`` and ``@parallel`` are complete.

.. function:: @parallel

   A parallel for loop of the form ::

        @parallel [reducer] for var = range
            body
        end

   The specified range is partitioned and locally executed across all workers.
   In case an optional reducer function is specified, @parallel performs local
   reductions on each worker with a final reduction on the calling process.

   Note that without a reducer function, @parallel executes asynchronously,
   i.e. it spawns independent tasks on all available workers and returns
   immediately without waiting for completion. To wait for completion, prefix
   the call with ``@sync``, like ::

        @sync @parallel for var = range
            body
        end



Distributed Arrays
------------------

.. function:: DArray(init, dims, [procs, dist])

   Construct a distributed array. The parameter ``init`` is a function that accepts a tuple of index ranges.
   This function should allocate a local chunk of the distributed array and initialize it for the specified indices.
   ``dims`` is the overall size of the distributed array. ``procs`` optionally specifies a vector of process IDs to use.
   If unspecified, the array is distributed over all worker processes only. Typically, when running in distributed mode,
   i.e., ``nprocs() > 1``, this would mean that no chunk of the distributed array exists on the process hosting the
   interactive julia prompt.
   ``dist`` is an integer vector specifying how many chunks the distributed array should be divided into in each dimension.

   For example, the ``dfill`` function that creates a distributed array and fills it with a value ``v`` is implemented as:

   ``dfill(v, args...) = DArray(I->fill(v, map(length,I)), args...)``

.. function:: dzeros(dims, ...)

   Construct a distributed array of zeros. Trailing arguments are the same as those accepted by :func:`DArray`.

.. function:: dones(dims, ...)

   Construct a distributed array of ones. Trailing arguments are the same as those accepted by :func:`DArray`.

.. function:: dfill(x, dims, ...)

   Construct a distributed array filled with value ``x``. Trailing arguments are the same as those accepted by :func:`DArray`.

.. function:: drand(dims, ...)

   Construct a distributed uniform random array. Trailing arguments are the same as those accepted by :func:`DArray`.

.. function:: drandn(dims, ...)

   Construct a distributed normal random array. Trailing arguments are the same as those accepted by :func:`DArray`.

.. function:: distribute(a)

   Convert a local array to distributed.

.. function:: localpart(d)

   Get the local piece of a distributed array. Returns an empty array if no local part exists on the calling process.

.. function:: localindexes(d)

   A tuple describing the indexes owned by the local process. Returns a tuple with empty ranges
   if no local part exists on the calling process.

.. function:: procs(d)

   Get the vector of processes storing pieces of ``d``.


Shared Arrays (Experimental, UNIX-only feature)
-----------------------------------------------

.. function:: SharedArray(T::Type, dims::NTuple; init=false, pids=Int[])

    Construct a SharedArray of a bitstype ``T``  and size ``dims`` across the processes
    specified by ``pids`` - all of which have to be on the same host.

    If ``pids`` is left unspecified, the shared array will be mapped across all processes
    on the current host, including the master. But, ``localindexes`` and ``indexpids``
    will only refer to worker processes. This facilitates work distribution code to use
    workers for actual computation with the master process acting as a driver.

    If an ``init`` function of the type ``initfn(S::SharedArray)`` is specified,
    it is called on all the participating workers.

.. function:: procs(S::SharedArray)

   Get the vector of processes that have mapped the shared array

.. function:: sdata(S::SharedArray)

   Returns the actual ``Array`` object backing ``S``

.. function:: indexpids(S::SharedArray)

   Returns the index of the current worker into the ``pids`` vector, i.e., the list of workers mapping
   the SharedArray
