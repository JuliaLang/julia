Tasks
-----

.. function:: Task(func)

   .. Docstring generated from Julia source

   Create a ``Task`` (i.e. thread, or coroutine) to execute the given function (which must be callable with no arguments). The task exits when this function returns.

.. function:: yieldto(task, arg = nothing)

   .. Docstring generated from Julia source

   Switch to the given task. The first time a task is switched to, the task's function is called with no arguments. On subsequent switches, ``arg`` is returned from the task's last call to ``yieldto``\ . This is a low-level call that only switches tasks, not considering states or scheduling in any way. Its use is discouraged.

.. function:: current_task()

   .. Docstring generated from Julia source

   Get the currently running ``Task``\ .

.. function:: istaskdone(task) -> Bool

   .. Docstring generated from Julia source

   Tell whether a task has exited.

.. function:: istaskstarted(task) -> Bool

   .. Docstring generated from Julia source

   Tell whether a task has started executing.

.. function:: consume(task, values...)

   .. Docstring generated from Julia source

   Receive the next value passed to ``produce`` by the specified task. Additional arguments may be passed, to be returned from the last ``produce`` call in the producer.

.. function:: produce(value)

   .. Docstring generated from Julia source

   Send the given value to the last ``consume`` call, switching to the consumer task. If the next ``consume`` call passes any values, they are returned by ``produce``\ .

.. function:: yield()

   .. Docstring generated from Julia source

   Switch to the scheduler to allow another scheduled task to run. A task that calls this function is still runnable, and will be restarted immediately if there are no other runnable tasks.

.. function:: task_local_storage(symbol)

   .. Docstring generated from Julia source

   Look up the value of a symbol in the current task's task-local storage.

.. function:: task_local_storage(symbol, value)

   .. Docstring generated from Julia source

   Assign a value to a symbol in the current task's task-local storage.

.. function:: task_local_storage(body, symbol, value)

   .. Docstring generated from Julia source

   Call the function ``body`` with a modified task-local storage, in which ``value`` is assigned to ``symbol``\ ; the previous value of ``symbol``\ , or lack thereof, is restored afterwards. Useful for emulating dynamic scoping.

.. function:: Condition()

   .. Docstring generated from Julia source

   Create an edge-triggered event source that tasks can wait for. Tasks that call ``wait`` on a ``Condition`` are suspended and queued. Tasks are woken up when ``notify`` is later called on the ``Condition``\ . Edge triggering means that only tasks waiting at the time ``notify`` is called can be woken up. For level-triggered notifications, you must keep extra state to keep track of whether a notification has happened. The ``Channel`` type does this, and so can be used for level-triggered events.

.. function:: notify(condition, val=nothing; all=true, error=false)

   .. Docstring generated from Julia source

   Wake up tasks waiting for a condition, passing them ``val``\ . If ``all`` is ``true`` (the default), all waiting tasks are woken, otherwise only one is. If ``error`` is ``true``\ , the passed value is raised as an exception in the woken tasks.

.. function:: schedule(t::Task, [val]; error=false)

   .. Docstring generated from Julia source

   Add a task to the scheduler's queue. This causes the task to run constantly when the system is otherwise idle, unless the task performs a blocking operation such as ``wait``\ .

   If a second argument is provided, it will be passed to the task (via the return value of ``yieldto``\ ) when it runs again. If ``error`` is ``true``\ , the value is raised as an exception in the woken task.

.. function:: @schedule

   .. Docstring generated from Julia source

   Wrap an expression in a ``Task`` and add it to the scheduler's queue.

.. function:: @task

   .. Docstring generated from Julia source

   Wrap an expression in a ``Task`` without executing it, and return the ``Task``\ . This only creates a task, and does not run it.

.. function:: sleep(seconds)

   .. Docstring generated from Julia source

   Block the current task for a specified number of seconds. The minimum sleep time is 1 millisecond or input of ``0.001``\ .

.. function:: ReentrantLock()

   .. Docstring generated from Julia source

   Creates a reentrant lock. The same task can acquire the lock as many times as required. Each lock must be matched with an unlock.

.. function:: lock(l::ReentrantLock)

   .. Docstring generated from Julia source

   Associates ``l`` with the current task. If ``l`` is already locked by a different task, waits for it to become available. The same task can acquire the lock multiple times. Each "lock" must be matched by an "unlock"

.. function:: unlock(l::ReentrantLock)

   .. Docstring generated from Julia source

   Releases ownership of the lock by the current task. If the lock had been acquired before, it just decrements an internal counter and returns immediately.

.. function:: Channel{T}(sz::Int)

   .. Docstring generated from Julia source

   Constructs a ``Channel`` that can hold a maximum of ``sz`` objects of type ``T``\ . ``put!`` calls on a full channel block till an object is removed with ``take!``\ .

   Other constructors:

     * ``Channel()`` - equivalent to ``Channel{Any}(32)``
     * ``Channel(sz::Int)`` equivalent to ``Channel{Any}(sz)``

General Parallel Computing Support
----------------------------------

.. function:: addprocs(n::Integer; exeflags=``) -> List of process identifiers

   .. Docstring generated from Julia source

   Launches workers using the in-built ``LocalManager`` which only launches workers on the local host.
   This can be used to take advantage of multiple cores. ``addprocs(4)`` will add 4 processes on the local machine.

.. function:: addprocs() -> List of process identifiers

   .. Docstring generated from Julia source

   Equivalent to ``addprocs(CPU_CORES)``

   Note that workers do not run a `.juliarc.jl` startup script, nor do they synchronize their global state
   (such as global variables, new method definitions, and loaded modules) with any of the other running processes.

.. function:: addprocs(machines; tunnel=false, sshflags=``, max_parallel=10, exeflags=``) -> List of process identifiers

   .. Docstring generated from Julia source

   Add processes on remote machines via SSH.
   Requires julia to be installed in the same location on each node, or to be available via a shared file system.

   ``machines`` is a vector of machine specifications.  Worker are started for each specification.

   A machine specification is either a string ``machine_spec`` or a tuple - ``(machine_spec, count)``

   ``machine_spec`` is a string of the form ``[user@]host[:port] [bind_addr[:port]]``. ``user`` defaults
   to current user, ``port`` to the standard ssh port. If ``[bind_addr[:port]]`` is specified, other
   workers will connect to this worker at the specified ``bind_addr`` and ``port``.

   ``count`` is the number of workers to be launched on the specified host. If specified as ``:auto``
   it will launch as many workers as the number of cores on the specific host.


   Keyword arguments:

   ``tunnel`` : if ``true`` then SSH tunneling will be used to connect to the worker from the master process.

   ``sshflags`` : specifies additional ssh options, e.g. :literal:`sshflags=\`-i /home/foo/bar.pem\`` .

   ``max_parallel`` : specifies the maximum number of workers connected to in parallel at a host. Defaults to 10.

   ``dir`` :  specifies the working directory on the workers. Defaults to the host's current directory (as found by ``pwd()``)

   ``exename`` :  name of the julia executable. Defaults to "$JULIA_HOME/julia" or "$JULIA_HOME/julia-debug" as the case may be.

   ``exeflags`` :  additional flags passed to the worker processes.

   Environment variables :

   If the master process fails to establish a connection with a newly launched worker within 60.0 seconds,
   the worker treats it a fatal situation and terminates. This timeout can be controlled via environment
   variable ``JULIA_WORKER_TIMEOUT``. The value of ``JULIA_WORKER_TIMEOUT`` on the master process, specifies
   the number of seconds a newly launched worker waits for connection establishment.

.. function:: addprocs(manager::ClusterManager; kwargs...) -> List of process identifiers

   .. Docstring generated from Julia source

   Launches worker processes via the specified cluster manager.

   For example Beowulf clusters are  supported via a custom cluster manager implemented in package ``ClusterManagers``.

   The number of seconds a newly launched worker waits for connection establishment from the master can be
   specified via variable ``JULIA_WORKER_TIMEOUT`` in the worker process's environment. Relevant only when using TCP/IP as transport.

.. function:: nprocs()

   .. Docstring generated from Julia source

   Get the number of available processes.

.. function:: nworkers()

   .. Docstring generated from Julia source

   Get the number of available worker processes. This is one less than ``nprocs()``\ . Equal to ``nprocs()`` if ``nprocs() == 1``\ .

.. function:: procs()

   .. Docstring generated from Julia source

   Returns a list of all process identifiers.

.. function:: workers()

   .. Docstring generated from Julia source

   Returns a list of all worker process identifiers.

.. function:: rmprocs(pids...)

   .. Docstring generated from Julia source

   Removes the specified workers.

.. function:: interrupt([pids...])

   .. Docstring generated from Julia source

   Interrupt the current executing task on the specified workers. This is equivalent to pressing Ctrl-C on the local machine. If no arguments are given, all workers are interrupted.

.. function:: myid()

   .. Docstring generated from Julia source

   Get the id of the current process.

.. function:: pmap(f, lsts...; err_retry=true, err_stop=false, pids=workers())

   .. Docstring generated from Julia source

   Transform collections ``lsts`` by applying ``f`` to each element in parallel.
   (Note that ``f`` must be made available to all worker processes; see :ref:`Code Availability and Loading Packages <man-parallel-computing-code-availability>` for details.)
   If ``nprocs() > 1``, the calling process will be dedicated to assigning tasks.
   All other available processes will be used as parallel workers, or on the processes specified by ``pids``.

   If ``err_retry`` is ``true``, it retries a failed application of ``f`` on a different worker.
   If ``err_stop`` is ``true``, it takes precedence over the value of ``err_retry`` and ``pmap`` stops execution on the first error.

.. function:: remotecall(func, id, args...)

   .. Docstring generated from Julia source

   Call a function asynchronously on the given arguments on the specified process. Returns a ``RemoteRef``\ .

.. function:: wait([x])

   .. Docstring generated from Julia source

   Block the current task until some event occurs, depending on the type of the argument:

     * ``RemoteRef``\ : Wait for a value to become available for the specified remote reference.
     * ``Channel``\ : Wait for a value to be appended to the channel.
     * ``Condition``\ : Wait for ``notify`` on a condition.
     * ``Process``\ : Wait for a process or process chain to exit. The ``exitcode`` field of a process can be used to determine success or failure.
     * ``Task``\ : Wait for a ``Task`` to finish, returning its result value. If the task fails with an exception, the exception is propagated (re-thrown in the task that called ``wait``\ ).
     * ``RawFD``\ : Wait for changes on a file descriptor (see ``poll_fd`` for keyword arguments and return code)

   If no argument is passed, the task blocks for an undefined period. If the task's state is set to ``:waiting``\ , it can only be restarted by an explicit call to ``schedule`` or ``yieldto``\ . If the task's state is ``:runnable``\ , it might be restarted unpredictably.

   Often ``wait`` is called within a ``while`` loop to ensure a waited-for condition is met before proceeding.

.. function:: fetch(x)

   .. Docstring generated from Julia source

   Waits and fetches a value from ``x`` depending on the type of ``x``\ . Does not remove the item fetched:

     * ``RemoteRef``\ : Wait for and get the value of a remote reference. If the remote value is an exception, throws a ``RemoteException`` which captures the remote exception and backtrace.
     * ``Channel`` : Wait for and get the first available item from the channel.

.. function:: remotecall_wait(func, id, args...)

   .. Docstring generated from Julia source

   Perform ``wait(remotecall(...))`` in one message.

.. function:: remotecall_fetch(func, id, args...)

   .. Docstring generated from Julia source

   Perform ``fetch(remotecall(...))`` in one message. Any remote exceptions are captured in a ``RemoteException`` and thrown.

.. function:: put!(RemoteRef, value)

   .. Docstring generated from Julia source

   Store a value to a remote reference. Implements "shared queue of length 1" semantics: if a value is already present, blocks until the value is removed with ``take!``\ . Returns its first argument.

.. function:: put!(Channel, value)

   .. Docstring generated from Julia source

   Appends an item to the channel. Blocks if the channel is full.

.. function:: take!(RemoteRef)

   .. Docstring generated from Julia source

   Fetch the value of a remote reference, removing it so that the reference is empty again.

.. function:: take!(Channel)

   .. Docstring generated from Julia source

   Removes and returns a value from a ``Channel``\ . Blocks till data is available.

.. function:: isready(r::RemoteRef)

   .. Docstring generated from Julia source

   Determine whether a ``RemoteRef`` has a value stored to it. Note that this function can cause race conditions, since by the time you receive its result it may no longer be true. It is recommended that this function only be used on a ``RemoteRef`` that is assigned once.

   If the argument ``RemoteRef`` is owned by a different node, this call will block to wait for the answer. It is recommended to wait for ``r`` in a separate task instead, or to use a local ``RemoteRef`` as a proxy:

   .. code-block:: julia

       rr = RemoteRef()
       @async put!(rr, remotecall_fetch(long_computation, p))
       isready(rr)  # will not block

.. function:: close(Channel)

   .. Docstring generated from Julia source

   Closes a channel. An exception is thrown by:

     * ``put!`` on a closed channel.
     * ``take!`` and ``fetch`` on an empty, closed channel.

.. function:: RemoteRef()

   .. Docstring generated from Julia source

   Make an uninitialized remote reference on the local machine.

.. function:: RemoteRef(n)

   .. Docstring generated from Julia source

   Make an uninitialized remote reference on process ``n``\ .

.. function:: timedwait(testcb::Function, secs::Float64; pollint::Float64=0.1)

   .. Docstring generated from Julia source

   Waits till ``testcb`` returns ``true`` or for ``secs`` seconds, whichever is earlier. ``testcb`` is polled every ``pollint`` seconds.

.. function:: @spawn

   .. Docstring generated from Julia source

   Creates a closure around an expression and runs it on an automatically-chosen process, returning a ``RemoteRef`` to the result.

.. function:: @spawnat

   .. Docstring generated from Julia source

   Accepts two arguments, ``p`` and an expression. A closure is created around the expression and run asynchronously on process ``p``\ . Returns a ``RemoteRef`` to the result.

.. function:: @fetch

   .. Docstring generated from Julia source

   Equivalent to ``fetch(@spawn expr)``\ .

.. function:: @fetchfrom

   .. Docstring generated from Julia source

   Equivalent to ``fetch(@spawnat p expr)``\ .

.. function:: @async

   .. Docstring generated from Julia source

   Wraps an expression in a closure and schedules it to run on the local machine. Also adds it to the set of items that the nearest enclosing ``@sync`` waits for.

.. function:: @sync

   .. Docstring generated from Julia source

   Wait until all dynamically-enclosed uses of ``@async``\ , ``@spawn``\ , ``@spawnat`` and ``@parallel`` are complete. All exceptions thrown by enclosed async operations are collected and thrown as a ``CompositeException``\ .

.. function:: @parallel

   .. Docstring generated from Julia source

   A parallel for loop of the form :

   .. code-block:: julia

       @parallel [reducer] for var = range
           body
       end

   The specified range is partitioned and locally executed across all workers. In case an optional reducer function is specified, ``@parallel`` performs local reductions on each worker with a final reduction on the calling process.

   Note that without a reducer function, ``@parallel`` executes asynchronously, i.e. it spawns independent tasks on all available workers and returns immediately without waiting for completion. To wait for completion, prefix the call with ``@sync``\ , like :

   .. code-block:: julia

       @sync @parallel for var = range
           body
       end

.. function:: @everywhere

   .. Docstring generated from Julia source

   Execute an expression on all processes. Errors on any of the processes are collected into a ``CompositeException`` and thrown.

Shared Arrays (Experimental, UNIX-only feature)
-----------------------------------------------

.. function:: SharedArray(T::Type, dims::NTuple; init=false, pids=Int[])

   .. Docstring generated from Julia source

   Construct a ``SharedArray`` of a bitstype ``T`` and size ``dims`` across the processes specified by ``pids`` - all of which have to be on the same host.

   If ``pids`` is left unspecified, the shared array will be mapped across all processes on the current host, including the master. But, ``localindexes`` and ``indexpids`` will only refer to worker processes. This facilitates work distribution code to use workers for actual computation with the master process acting as a driver.

   If an ``init`` function of the type ``initfn(S::SharedArray)`` is specified, it is called on all the participating workers.

.. function:: procs(S::SharedArray)

   .. Docstring generated from Julia source

   Get the vector of processes that have mapped the shared array

.. function:: sdata(S::SharedArray)

   .. Docstring generated from Julia source

   Returns the actual ``Array`` object backing ``S``

.. function:: indexpids(S::SharedArray)

   .. Docstring generated from Julia source

   Returns the index of the current worker into the ``pids`` vector, i.e., the list of workers mapping the SharedArray

Cluster Manager Interface
-------------------------
    This interface provides a mechanism to launch and manage Julia workers on different cluster environments.
    LocalManager, for launching additional workers on the same host and SSHManager, for launching on remote
    hosts via ssh are present in Base. TCP/IP sockets are used to connect and transport messages
    between processes. It is possible for Cluster Managers to provide a different transport.

.. function:: launch(manager::FooManager, params::Dict, launched::Vector{WorkerConfig}, launch_ntfy::Condition)

   .. Docstring generated from Julia source

   Implemented by cluster managers. For every Julia worker launched by this function, it should append a ``WorkerConfig`` entry to ``launched`` and notify ``launch_ntfy``\ . The function MUST exit once all workers, requested by ``manager`` have been launched. ``params`` is a dictionary of all keyword arguments ``addprocs`` was called with.

.. function:: manage(manager::FooManager, pid::Int, config::WorkerConfig. op::Symbol)

   .. Docstring generated from Julia source

   Implemented by cluster managers. It is called on the master process, during a worker's lifetime,
   with appropriate ``op`` values:

       - with ``:register``/``:deregister`` when a worker is added / removed
         from the Julia worker pool.
       - with ``:interrupt`` when ``interrupt(workers)`` is called. The
         :class:`ClusterManager` should signal the appropriate worker with an
         interrupt signal.
       - with ``:finalize`` for cleanup purposes.

.. function:: kill(manager::FooManager, pid::Int, config::WorkerConfig)

   .. Docstring generated from Julia source

   Implemented by cluster managers. It is called on the master process, by ``rmprocs``\ . It should cause the remote worker specified by ``pid`` to exit. ``Base.kill(manager::ClusterManager.....)`` executes a remote ``exit()`` on ``pid``

.. function:: init_worker(manager::FooManager)

   .. Docstring generated from Julia source

   Called by cluster managers implementing custom transports. It initializes a newly launched process as a worker. Command line argument ``--worker`` has the effect of initializing a process as a worker using TCP/IP sockets for transport.

.. function:: connect(manager::FooManager, pid::Int, config::WorkerConfig) -> (instrm::AsyncStream, outstrm::AsyncStream)

   .. Docstring generated from Julia source

   Implemented by cluster managers using custom transports. It should establish a logical connection to worker with id ``pid``\ , specified by ``config`` and return a pair of ``AsyncStream`` objects. Messages from ``pid`` to current process will be read off ``instrm``\ , while messages to be sent to ``pid`` will be written to ``outstrm``\ . The custom transport implementation must ensure that messages are delivered and received completely and in order. ``Base.connect(manager::ClusterManager.....)`` sets up TCP/IP socket connections in-between workers.

.. function:: Base.process_messages(instrm::AsyncStream, outstrm::AsyncStream)

   .. Docstring generated from Julia source

   Called by cluster managers using custom transports. It should be called when the custom transport implementation receives the first message from a remote worker. The custom transport must manage a logical connection to the remote worker and provide two ``AsyncStream`` objects, one for incoming messages and the other for messages addressed to the remote worker.
