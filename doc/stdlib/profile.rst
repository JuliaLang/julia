.. module:: Profile

***********
 Profiling
***********

.. currentmodule:: Base

.. function:: @profile

   .. Docstring generated from Julia source

   ``@profile <expression>`` runs your expression while taking periodic backtraces. These are appended to an internal buffer of backtraces.

.. currentmodule:: Base.Profile

The methods in :mod:`Base.Profile` are not exported and need to be called e.g. as ``Profile.print()``.

.. function:: clear()

   .. Docstring generated from Julia source

   Clear any existing backtraces from the internal buffer.

.. function:: print([io::IO = STDOUT,] [data::Vector]; kwargs...)

   .. Docstring generated from Julia source

   Prints profiling results to ``io`` (by default, ``STDOUT``\ ). If you do not supply a ``data`` vector, the internal buffer of accumulated backtraces will be used.

   The keyword arguments can be any combination of:

   * ``format`` can be ``:tree`` (default) or ``:flat``\ .
   * If ``C`` is ``true``\ , backtraces from C and Fortran code are shown (normally they are excluded).
   * If ``combine`` is ``true`` (default), instruction pointers are merged that correspond to the same line of code.
   * ``maxdepth`` can be used to limit the depth of printing in ``:tree`` format, while ``sortedby`` can be used to control the order in ``:flat`` format ``:filefuncline`` (default) sorts by the source line, whereas ``:count`` sorts in order of number of collected samples.
   * ``noisefloor`` only shows frames that exceed the heuristic noise floor of the sample (only applies to format ``:tree``\ ). A suggested value to try for this is 2.0 (the default is 0). This parameters hides samples for which ``n <= noisefloor * âˆšN``\ , where ``n`` is the number of samples on this line, and ``N`` is the number of samples for the callee.
   * ``mincount`` can also be used to limit the printout to only those lines with at least mincount occurrences.

.. function:: print([io::IO = STDOUT,] data::Vector, lidict::LineInfoDict; kwargs...)

   .. Docstring generated from Julia source

   Prints profiling results to ``io``\ . This variant is used to examine results exported by a previous call to :func:`retrieve`\ . Supply the vector ``data`` of backtraces and a dictionary ``lidict`` of line information.

   See ``Profile.print([io], data)`` for an explanation of the valid keyword arguments.

.. function:: init(; n::Integer, delay::Float64)

   .. Docstring generated from Julia source

   Configure the ``delay`` between backtraces (measured in seconds), and the number ``n`` of instruction pointers that may be stored. Each instruction pointer corresponds to a single line of code; backtraces generally consist of a long list of instruction pointers. Default settings can be obtained by calling this function with no arguments, and each can be set independently using keywords or in the order ``(n, delay)``\ .

.. function:: fetch() -> data

   .. Docstring generated from Julia source

   Returns a reference to the internal buffer of backtraces. Note that subsequent operations, like :func:`clear`\ , can affect ``data`` unless you first make a copy. Note that the values in ``data`` have meaning only on this machine in the current session, because it depends on the exact memory addresses used in JIT-compiling. This function is primarily for internal use; :func:`retrieve` may be a better choice for most users.

.. function:: retrieve() -> data, lidict

   .. Docstring generated from Julia source

   "Exports" profiling results in a portable format, returning the set of all backtraces (``data``\ ) and a dictionary that maps the (session-specific) instruction pointers in ``data`` to ``LineInfo`` values that store the file name, function name, and line number. This function allows you to save profiling results for future analysis.

.. function:: callers(funcname, [data, lidict], [filename=<filename>], [linerange=<start:stop>]) -> Vector{Tuple{count, lineinfo}}

   .. Docstring generated from Julia source

   Given a previous profiling run, determine who called a particular function. Supplying the filename (and optionally, range of line numbers over which the function is defined) allows you to disambiguate an overloaded method. The returned value is a vector containing a count of the number of calls and line information about the caller. One can optionally supply backtrace ``data`` obtained from :func:`retrieve`\ ; otherwise, the current internal profile buffer is used.

.. function:: clear_malloc_data()

   .. Docstring generated from Julia source

   Clears any stored memory allocation data when running julia with ``--track-allocation``\ . Execute the command(s) you want to test (to force JIT-compilation), then call :func:`clear_malloc_data`\ . Then execute your command(s) again, quit Julia, and examine the resulting ``*.mem`` files.
