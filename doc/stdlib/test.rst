Testing Base Julia
------------------

Julia is under rapid development and has an extensive test suite to
verify functionality across multiple platforms. If you build Julia
from source, you can run this test suite with ``make test``. In a
binary install, you can run the test suite using ``Base.runtests()``.

.. currentmodule:: Base

.. function:: runtests([tests=["all"] [, numcores=ceil(Int, Sys.CPU_CORES / 2) ]])

   .. Docstring generated from Julia source

   Run the Julia unit tests listed in ``tests``\ , which can be either a string or an array of strings, using ``numcores`` processors. (not exported)

.. module:: Base.Test

Basic Unit Tests
----------------

The ``Base.Test`` module provides simple *unit testing* functionality.
Unit testing is a way to see if your code is correct by checking that
the results are what you expect. It can be helpful to ensure your code
still works after you make changes, and can be used when developing as
a way of specifying the behaviors your code should have when complete.

Simple unit testing can be performed with the :func:`@test` and :func:`@test_throws`
macros:

.. function:: @test ex

   .. Docstring generated from Julia source

   Tests that the expression ``ex`` evaluates to ``true``\ . Returns a ``Pass`` ``Result`` if it does, a ``Fail`` ``Result`` if it is ``false``\ , and an ``Error`` ``Result`` if it could not be evaluated.

.. function:: @test_throws extype ex

   .. Docstring generated from Julia source

   Tests that the expression ``ex`` throws an exception of type ``extype``\ .

For example, suppose we want to check our new function ``foo(x)`` works
as expected::

    julia> using Base.Test

    julia> foo(x) = length(x)^2
    foo (generic function with 1 method)

If the condition is true, a ``Pass`` is returned::

    julia> @test foo("bar") == 9
    Test Passed
      Expression: foo("bar") == 9
       Evaluated: 9 == 9

    julia> @test foo("fizz") >= 10
    Test Passed
      Expression: foo("fizz") >= 10
       Evaluated: 16 >= 10

If the condition is false, then a ``Fail`` is returned and an
exception is thrown::

    julia> @test foo("f") == 20
    Test Failed
      Expression: foo("f") == 20
       Evaluated: 1 == 20
    ERROR: There was an error during testing
     in record at test.jl:268
     in do_test at test.jl:191

If the condition could not be evaluated because an exception was thrown,
which occurs in this case because :func:`length` is not defined for
symbols, an ``Error`` object is returned and an exception is thrown::

    julia> @test foo(:cat) == 1
    Error During Test
      Test threw an exception of type MethodError
      Expression: foo(:cat) == 1
      MethodError: `length` has no method matching length(::Symbol)
       in foo at none:1
       in anonymous at test.jl:159
       in do_test at test.jl:180
    ERROR: There was an error during testing
     in record at test.jl:268
     in do_test at test.jl:191

If we expect that evaluating an expression *should* throw an exception,
then we can use :func:`@test_throws` to check that this occurs::

    julia> @test_throws MethodError foo(:cat)
    Test Passed
      Expression: foo(:cat)
       Evaluated: MethodError


Working with Test Sets
----------------------

Typically a large of number of tests are used to make sure functions
work correctly over a range of inputs. In the event a test fails, the
default behavior is to throw an exception immediately. However, it is
normally preferable to run the rest of the tests first to get a
better picture of how many errors there are in the code being tested.

The :func:`@testset` macro can be used to group tests into *sets*.
All the tests in a test set will be run, and at the end of the test set
a summary will be printed. If any of the tests failed, or could not be
evaluated due to an error, the test set will then throw a ``TestSetException``.

.. function:: @testset [CustomTestSet] [option=val  ...] ["description"] begin ... end
              @testset [CustomTestSet] [option=val  ...] ["description $v"] for v in (...) ... end
              @testset [CustomTestSet] [option=val  ...] ["description $v, $w"] for v in (...), w in (...) ... end

   .. Docstring generated from Julia source

   Starts a new test set, or multiple test sets if a ``for`` loop is provided.

   If no custom testset type is given it defaults to creating a ``DefaultTestSet``\ . ``DefaultTestSet`` records all the results and, and if there are any ``Fail``\ s or ``Error``\ s, throws an exception at the end of the top-level (non-nested) test set, along with a summary of the test results.

   Any custom testset type (subtype of ``AbstractTestSet``\ ) can be given and it will also be used for any nested ``@testset`` invocations. The given options are only applied to the test set where they are given. The default test set type does not take any options.

   The description string accepts interpolation from the loop indices. If no description is provided, one is constructed based on the variables.

   By default the ``@testset`` macro will return the testset object itself, though this behavior can be customized in other testset types. If a ``for`` loop is used then the macro collects and returns a list of the return values of the ``finish`` method, which by default will return a list of the testset objects used in each iteration.

We can put our tests for the ``foo(x)`` function in a test set::

    julia> @testset "Foo Tests" begin
               @test foo("a")   == 1
               @test foo("ab")  == 4
               @test foo("abc") == 9
           end
    Test Summary: | Pass  Total
    Foo Tests     |    3      3

Test sets can also be nested::

    julia> @testset "Foo Tests" begin
               @testset "Animals" begin
                   @test foo("cat") == 9
                   @test foo("dog") == foo("cat")
               end
               @testset "Arrays $i" for i in 1:3
                   @test foo(zeros(i)) == i^2
                   @test foo(ones(i)) == i^2
               end
           end
    Test Summary: | Pass  Total
    Foo Tests     |    8      8

In the event that a nested test set has no failures, as happened here,
it will be hidden in the summary. If we do have a test failure, only
the details for the failed test sets will be shown::

    julia> @testset "Foo Tests" begin
               @testset "Animals" begin
                   @testset "Felines" begin
                       @test foo("cat") == 9
                   end
                   @testset "Canines" begin
                       @test foo("dog") == 9
                   end
               end
               @testset "Arrays" begin
                   @test foo(zeros(2)) == 4
                   @test foo(ones(4)) == 15
               end
           end

    Arrays: Test Failed
      Expression: foo(ones(4)) == 15
       Evaluated: 16 == 15
     in record at test.jl:297
     in do_test at test.jl:191
    Test Summary: | Pass  Fail  Total
    Foo Tests     |    3     1      4
      Animals     |    2            2
      Arrays      |    1     1      2
    ERROR: Some tests did not pass: 3 passed, 1 failed, 0 errored, 0 broken.
     in finish at test.jl:362


Other Test Macros
-----------------

As calculations on floating-point values can be imprecise, you can
perform approximate equality checks using either ``@test a ≈ b``
(where ``≈``, typed via tab completion of ``\approx``,
is the :func:`isapprox` function) or use :func:`isapprox` directly.

An alternative is the ``@test_approx_eq`` macro (which differs from
``isapprox`` in that it treats NaN values as equal and has a smaller
default tolerance) or ``@test_approx_eq_eps`` (which takes an extra
argument indicating the relative tolerance)::

  julia> @test 1 ≈ 0.999999999

  julia> @test 1 ≈ 0.999999
  ERROR: test failed: 1 isapprox 0.999999
   in expression: 1 ≈ 0.999999
   in error at error.jl:21
   in default_handler at test.jl:30
   in do_test at test.jl:53

  julia> @test_approx_eq 1. 0.999999999
  ERROR: assertion failed: |1.0 - 0.999999999| < 2.220446049250313e-12
    1.0 = 1.0
    0.999999999 = 0.999999999
   in test_approx_eq at test.jl:75
   in test_approx_eq at test.jl:80

  julia> @test_approx_eq 1. 0.9999999999999

  julia> @test_approx_eq_eps 1. 0.999 1e-2

  julia> @test_approx_eq_eps 1. 0.999 1e-3
  ERROR: assertion failed: |1.0 - 0.999| <= 0.001
    1.0 = 1.0
    0.999 = 0.999
    difference = 0.0010000000000000009 > 0.001
   in error at error.jl:22
   in test_approx_eq at test.jl:68

Note that these macros will fail immediately, and are not compatible
with :func:`@testset`, so using ``@test isapprox`` is encouraged when
writing new tests.

.. function:: @test_approx_eq(a, b)

   .. Docstring generated from Julia source

   Test two floating point numbers ``a`` and ``b`` for equality taking into account small numerical errors.

.. function:: @test_approx_eq_eps(a, b, tol)

   .. Docstring generated from Julia source

   Test two floating point numbers ``a`` and ``b`` for equality taking into account a margin of tolerance given by ``tol``\ .

.. function:: @inferred f(x)

   .. Docstring generated from Julia source

   Tests that the call expression ``f(x)`` returns a value of the same type inferred by the compiler. It is useful to check for type stability.

   ``f(x)`` can be any call expression. Returns the result of ``f(x)`` if the types match, and an ``Error`` ``Result`` if it finds different types.

   .. doctest::

       julia> using Base.Test

       julia> f(a,b,c) = b > 1 ? 1 : 1.0
       f (generic function with 1 method)

       julia> typeof(f(1,2,3))
       Int64

       julia> @code_warntype f(1,2,3)
       ...
       Body:
         begin
             unless (Base.slt_int)(1,b::Int64)::Bool goto 3
             return 1
             3:
             return 1.0
         end::UNION{FLOAT64,INT64}

       julia> @inferred f(1,2,3)
       ERROR: return type Int64 does not match inferred return type Union{Float64,Int64}
        in error(::String) at ./error.jl:26
        ...

       julia> @inferred max(1,2)
       2

Broken Tests
------------

If a test fails consistently it can be changed to use the :func:`@test_broken`
macro. This will denote the test as ``Broken`` if the test continues to fail
and alerts the user via an ``Error`` if the test succeeds.

.. function:: @test_broken ex

   .. Docstring generated from Julia source

   Indicates a test that should pass but currently consistently fails. Tests that the expression ``ex`` evaluates to ``false`` or causes an exception. Returns a ``Broken`` ``Result`` if it does, or an ``Error`` ``Result`` if the expression evaluates to ``true``\ .

:func:`@test_skip` is also available to skip a test without evaluation, but
counting the skipped test in the test set reporting. The test will not run but
gives a ``Broken`` ``Result``.

.. function:: @test_skip ex

   .. Docstring generated from Julia source

   Marks a test that should not be executed but should be included in test summary reporting as ``Broken``\ . This can be useful for tests that intermittently fail, or tests of not-yet-implemented functionality.

Creating Custom ``AbstractTestSet`` Types
-----------------------------------------

Packages can create their own ``AbstractTestSet`` subtypes by implementing the
``record`` and ``finish`` methods. The subtype should have a one-argument
constructor taking a description string, with any options passed in as keyword
arguments.

.. function:: record(ts::AbstractTestSet, res::Result)

   .. Docstring generated from Julia source

   Record a result to a testset. This function is called by the ``@testset`` infrastructure each time a contained ``@test`` macro completes, and is given the test result (which could be an ``Error``\ ). This will also be called with an ``Error`` if an exception is thrown inside the test block but outside of a ``@test`` context.

.. function:: finish(ts::AbstractTestSet)

   .. Docstring generated from Julia source

   Do any final processing necessary for the given testset. This is called by the ``@testset`` infrastructure after a test block executes. One common use for this function is to record the testset to the parent's results list, using ``get_testset``\ .

``Base.Test`` takes responsibility for maintaining a stack of nested testsets as
they are executed, but any result accumulation is the responsibility of the
``AbstractTestSet`` subtype. You can access this stack with the ``get_testset`` and
``get_testset_depth`` methods. Note that these functions are not exported.

.. function:: get_testset()

   .. Docstring generated from Julia source

   Retrieve the active test set from the task's local storage. If no test set is active, use the fallback default test set.

.. function:: get_testset_depth()

   .. Docstring generated from Julia source

   Returns the number of active test sets, not including the defaut test set

``Base.Test`` also makes sure that nested ``@testset`` invocations use the same
``AbstractTestSet`` subtype as their parent unless it is set explicitly. It does
not propagate any properties of the testset. Option inheritance behavior can be
implemented by packages using the stack infrastructure that ``Base.Test``
provides.

Defining a basic ``AbstractTestSet`` subtype might look like::

    import Base.Test: record, finish
    using Base.Test: AbstractTestSet, Result, Pass, Fail, Error
    using Base.Test: get_testset_depth, get_testset
    immutable CustomTestSet <: Base.Test.AbstractTestSet
        description::AbstractString
        foo::Int
        results::Vector
        # constructor takes a description string and options keyword arguments
        CustomTestSet(desc; foo=1) = new(desc, foo, [])
    end

    record(ts::CustomTestSet, child::AbstractTestSet) = push!(ts.results, child)
    record(ts::CustomTestSet, res::Result) = push!(ts.results, res)
    function finish(ts::CustomTestSet)
        # just record if we're not the top-level parent
        if get_testset_depth() > 0
            record(get_testset(), ts)
        end
        ts
    end

And using that testset looks like::

    @testset CustomTestSet foo=4 "custom testset inner 2" begin
        # this testset should inherit the type, but not the argument.
        @testset "custom testset inner" begin
            @test true
        end
    end
