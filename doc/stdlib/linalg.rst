Standard Functions
------------------

.. module:: Base.LinAlg

.. currentmodule:: Base

Linear algebra functions in Julia are largely implemented by calling functions from `LAPACK <http://www.netlib.org/lapack/>`_.  Sparse factorizations call functions from `SuiteSparse <http://faculty.cse.tamu.edu/davis/suitesparse.html>`_.

.. function:: *(A, B)

   .. Docstring generated from Julia source

   Matrix multiplication.

.. function:: \\(A, B)

   .. Docstring generated from Julia source

   Matrix division using a polyalgorithm. For input matrices ``A`` and ``B``\ , the result ``X`` is such that ``A*X == B`` when ``A`` is square.  The solver that is used depends upon the structure of ``A``\ .  A direct solver is used for upper or lower triangular ``A``\ .  For Hermitian ``A`` (equivalent to symmetric ``A`` for non-complex ``A``\ ) the ``BunchKaufman`` factorization is used. Otherwise an LU factorization is used. For rectangular ``A`` the result is the minimum-norm least squares solution computed by a pivoted QR factorization of ``A`` and a rank estimate of ``A`` based on the R factor.

   When ``A`` is sparse, a similar polyalgorithm is used. For indefinite matrices, the ``LDLt`` factorization does not use pivoting during the numerical factorization and therefore the procedure can fail even for invertible matrices.

.. function:: dot(x, y)
              ⋅(x,y)

   .. Docstring generated from Julia source

   Compute the dot product. For complex vectors, the first vector is conjugated.

.. function:: vecdot(x, y)

   .. Docstring generated from Julia source

   For any iterable containers ``x`` and ``y`` (including arrays of any dimension) of numbers (or any element type for which ``dot`` is defined), compute the Euclidean dot product (the sum of ``dot(x[i],y[i])``\ ) as if they were vectors.

.. function:: cross(x, y)
              ×(x,y)

   .. Docstring generated from Julia source

   Compute the cross product of two 3-vectors.

.. function:: factorize(A)

   .. Docstring generated from Julia source

   Compute a convenient factorization (including LU, Cholesky, Bunch-Kaufman, LowerTriangular, UpperTriangular) of ``A``\ , based upon the type of the input matrix. The return value can then be reused for efficient solving of multiple systems. For example: ``A=factorize(A); x=A\b; y=A\C``\ .

.. function:: full(F)

   .. Docstring generated from Julia source

   Reconstruct the matrix ``A`` from the factorization ``F=factorize(A)``\ .

.. function:: lu(A) -> L, U, p

   .. Docstring generated from Julia source

   Compute the LU factorization of ``A``\ , such that ``A[p,:] = L*U``\ .

.. function:: lufact(A [,pivot=Val{true}]) -> F::LU

   .. Docstring generated from Julia source

   Compute the LU factorization of ``A``\ .

   In most cases, if ``A`` is a subtype ``S`` of ``AbstractMatrix{T}`` with an element type ``T`` supporting ``+``\ , ``-``\ , ``*`` and ``/``\ , the return type is ``LU{T,S{T}}``\ . If pivoting is chosen (default) the element type should also support ``abs`` and ``<``\ .

   The individual components of the factorization ``F`` can be accessed by indexing:

   +-----------+-----------------------------------------+
   | Component | Description                             |
   +===========+=========================================+
   | ``F[:L]`` | ``L`` (lower triangular) part of ``LU`` |
   +-----------+-----------------------------------------+
   | ``F[:U]`` | ``U`` (upper triangular) part of ``LU`` |
   +-----------+-----------------------------------------+
   | ``F[:p]`` | (right) permutation ``Vector``          |
   +-----------+-----------------------------------------+
   | ``F[:P]`` | (right) permutation ``Matrix``          |
   +-----------+-----------------------------------------+

   The relationship between ``F`` and ``A`` is

   ``F[:L]*F[:U] == A[F[:p], :]``

   ``F`` further supports the following functions:

   +--------------------+--------+--------------------------+
   | Supported function | ``LU`` | ``LU{T,Tridiagonal{T}}`` |

   +--------------------+--------+--------------------------+

.. function:: lufact(A::SparseMatrixCSC) -> F::UmfpackLU

   .. Docstring generated from Julia source

   Compute the LU factorization of a sparse matrix ``A``\ .

   For sparse ``A`` with real or complex element type, the return type of ``F`` is ``UmfpackLU{Tv, Ti}``\ , with ``Tv`` = ``Float64`` or ``Complex128`` respectively and ``Ti`` is an integer type (``Int32`` or ``Int64``\ ).

   The individual components of the factorization ``F`` can be accessed by indexing:

   +-------------+-----------------------------------------+
   | Component   | Description                             |
   +=============+=========================================+
   | ``F[:L]``   | ``L`` (lower triangular) part of ``LU`` |
   +-------------+-----------------------------------------+
   | ``F[:U]``   | ``U`` (upper triangular) part of ``LU`` |
   +-------------+-----------------------------------------+
   | ``F[:p]``   | right permutation ``Vector``            |
   +-------------+-----------------------------------------+
   | ``F[:q]``   | left permutation ``Vector``             |
   +-------------+-----------------------------------------+
   | ``F[:Rs]``  | ``Vector`` of scaling factors           |
   +-------------+-----------------------------------------+
   | ``F[:(:)]`` | ``(L,U,p,q,Rs)`` components             |
   +-------------+-----------------------------------------+

   The relation between ``F`` and ``A`` is

   ``F[:L]*F[:U] == (F[:Rs] .* A)[F[:p], F[:q]]``

   ``F`` further supports the following functions:

   * :func:`\\`
   * :func:`cond`
   * :func:`det`

   ** Implementation note **

   ``lufact(A::SparseMatrixCSC)`` uses the UMFPACK library that is part of SuiteSparse. As this library only supports sparse matrices with ``Float64`` or ``Complex128`` elements, ``lufact`` converts ``A`` into a copy that is of type ``SparseMatrixCSC{Float64}`` or ``SparseMatrixCSC{Complex128}`` as appropriate.

.. function:: lufact!(A) -> LU

   .. Docstring generated from Julia source

   ``lufact!`` is the same as :func:`lufact`\ , but saves space by overwriting the input ``A``\ , instead of creating a copy.  For sparse ``A`` the ``nzval`` field is not overwritten but the index fields, ``colptr`` and ``rowval`` are decremented in place, converting from 1-based indices to 0-based indices.

.. function:: chol(A::AbstractMatrix) -> U

   .. Docstring generated from Julia source

   Compute the Cholesky factorization of a positive definite matrix ``A`` and return the UpperTriangular matrix ``U`` such that ``A = U'U``\ .

.. function:: chol(x::Number) -> y

   .. Docstring generated from Julia source

   Compute the square root of a non-negative number ``x``\ .

.. function:: cholfact(A::StridedMatrix, uplo::Symbol, Val{false}) -> Cholesky

   .. Docstring generated from Julia source

   Compute the Cholesky factorization of a dense symmetric positive definite matrix ``A`` and return a ``Cholesky`` factorization. The ``uplo`` argument may be ``:L`` for using the lower part or ``:U`` for the upper part of ``A``\ . The default is to use ``:U``\ . The triangular Cholesky factor can be obtained from the factorization ``F`` with: ``F[:L]`` and ``F[:U]``\ . The following functions are available for ``Cholesky`` objects: ``size``\ , ``, ``inv``\ , ``det``\ . A ``PosDefException`` exception is thrown in case the matrix is not positive definite.

.. function:: cholfact(A::StridedMatrix, uplo::Symbol, Val{true}; tol = 0.0) -> CholeskyPivoted

   .. Docstring generated from Julia source

   Compute the pivoted Cholesky factorization of a dense symmetric positive semi-definite matrix ``A`` and return a ``CholeskyPivoted`` factorization. The ``uplo`` argument may be ``:L`` for using the lower part or ``:U`` for the upper part of ``A``\ . The default is to use ``:U``\ . The triangular Cholesky factor can be obtained from the factorization ``F`` with: ``F[:L]`` and ``F[:U]``\ . The following functions are available for ``PivotedCholesky`` objects: ``size``\ , ``, ``inv``\ , ``det``\ , and ``rank``\ . The argument ``tol`` determines the tolerance for determining the rank. For negative values, the tolerance is the machine precision.

.. function:: cholfact(::Union{SparseMatrixCSC{<:Real},SparseMatrixCSC{Complex{<:Real}},
                  Symmetric{<:Real,SparseMatrixCSC{<:Real,
                  SuiteSparse_long}},Hermitian{Complex{<:Real},SparseMatrixCSC{Complex{<:Real},
                  SuiteSparse_long}}}; shift = 0.0, perm=Int[]) -> CHOLMOD.Factor

   .. Docstring generated from Julia source

   Compute the Cholesky factorization of a sparse positive definite matrix ``A``\ . A fill-reducing permutation is used. ``F = cholfact(A)`` is most frequently used to solve systems of equations with ``F``\ , but also the methods ``diag``\ , ``det``\ , ``logdet`` are defined for ``F``\ . You can also extract individual factors from ``F``\ , using ``F[:L]``\ . However, since pivoting is on by default, the factorization is internally represented as ``A == P'*L*L'*P`` with a permutation matrix ``P``\ ; using just ``L`` without accounting for ``P`` will give incorrect answers. To include the effects of permutation, it's typically preferable to extact "combined" factors like ``PtL = F[:PtL]`` (the equivalent of ``P'*L``\ ) and ``LtP = F[:UP]`` (the equivalent of ``L'*P``\ ).

   Setting optional ``shift`` keyword argument computes the factorization of ``A+shift*I`` instead of ``A``\ . If the ``perm`` argument is nonempty, it should be a permutation of ``1:size(A,1)`` giving the ordering to use (instead of CHOLMOD's default AMD ordering).

   ** Note **

   This method uses the CHOLMOD library from SuiteSparse, which only supports doubles or complex doubles. Input matrices not of those element types will be converted to ``SparseMatrixCSC{Float64}`` or ``SparseMatrixCSC{Complex128}`` as appropriate.

   Many other functions from CHOLMOD are wrapped but not exported from the ``Base.SparseArrays.CHOLMOD`` module.

.. function:: cholfact!(F::Factor, A::Union{SparseMatrixCSC{<:Real},
                  SparseMatrixCSC{Complex{<:Real}},
                  Symmetric{<:Real,SparseMatrixCSC{<:Real,SuiteSparse_long}},
                  Hermitian{Complex{<:Real},SparseMatrixCSC{Complex{<:Real},SuiteSparse_long}}};
                  shift = 0.0) -> CHOLMOD.Factor

   .. Docstring generated from Julia source

   Compute the Cholesky (:math:`LL'`\ ) factorization of ``A``\ , reusing the symbolic factorization ``F``\ .

   ** Note **

   This method uses the CHOLMOD library from SuiteSparse, which only supports doubles or complex doubles. Input matrices not of those element types will be converted to ``SparseMatrixCSC{Float64}`` or ``SparseMatrixCSC{Complex128}`` as appropriate.

.. function:: cholfact!(A::StridedMatrix, uplo::Symbol, Val{false}) -> Cholesky

   .. Docstring generated from Julia source

   The same as ``cholfact``\ , but saves space by overwriting the input ``A``\ , instead of creating a copy.

.. function:: cholfact!(A::StridedMatrix, uplo::Symbol, Val{true}) -> PivotedCholesky

   .. Docstring generated from Julia source

   The same as ``cholfact``\ , but saves space by overwriting the input ``A``\ , instead of creating a copy.

.. currentmodule:: Base.LinAlg

.. function:: lowrankupdate(C::Cholesky, v::StridedVector) -> CC::Cholesky

   .. Docstring generated from Julia source

   Update a Cholesky factorization ``C`` with the vector ``v``\ . If ``A = C[:U]'C[:U]`` then ``CC = cholfact(C[:U]'C[:U] + v*v')`` but the computation of ``CC`` only uses ``O(n^2)`` operations.

.. function:: lowrankdowndate(C::Cholesky, v::StridedVector) -> CC::Cholesky

   .. Docstring generated from Julia source

   Downdate a Cholesky factorization ``C`` with the vector ``v``\ . If ``A = C[:U]'C[:U]`` then ``CC = cholfact(C[:U]'C[:U] - v*v')`` but the computation of ``CC`` only uses ``O(n^2)`` operations.

.. function:: lowrankupdate!(C::Cholesky, v::StridedVector) -> CC::Cholesky

   .. Docstring generated from Julia source

   Update a Cholesky factorization ``C`` with the vector ``v``\ . If ``A = C[:U]'C[:U]`` then ``CC = cholfact(C[:U]'C[:U] + v*v')`` but the computation of ``CC`` only uses ``O(n^2)`` operations. The input factorization ``C`` is updated in place such that on exit ``C == CC``\ . The vector ``v`` is destroyed during the computation.

.. function:: lowrankdowndate!(C::Cholesky, v::StridedVector) -> CC::Cholesky

   .. Docstring generated from Julia source

   Downdate a Cholesky factorization ``C`` with the vector ``v``\ . If ``A = C[:U]'C[:U]`` then ``CC = cholfact(C[:U]'C[:U] - v*v')`` but the computation of ``CC`` only uses ``O(n^2)`` operations. The input factorization ``C`` is updated in place such that on exit ``C == CC``\ . The vector ``v`` is destroyed during the computation.

.. currentmodule:: Base

.. function:: ldltfact(::SymTridiagonal) -> LDLt

   .. Docstring generated from Julia source

   Compute an ``LDLt`` factorization of a real symmetric tridiagonal matrix such that ``A = L*Diagonal(d)*L'`` where ``L`` is a unit lower triangular matrix and ``d`` is a vector. The main use of an ``LDLt`` factorization ``F = ldltfact(A)`` is to solve the linear system of equations ``Ax = b`` with ``F\b``\ .

.. function:: ldltfact(::Union{SparseMatrixCSC{<:Real},SparseMatrixCSC{Complex{<:Real}},
                  Symmetric{<:Real,SparseMatrixCSC{<:Real,SuiteSparse_long}},
                  Hermitian{Complex{<:Real},SparseMatrixCSC{Complex{<:Real},SuiteSparse_long}}};
                  shift = 0.0, perm=Int[]) -> CHOLMOD.Factor

   .. Docstring generated from Julia source

   Compute the :math:`LDL'` factorization of a sparse symmetric or Hermitian matrix. A fill-reducing permutation is used. ``F = ldltfact(A)`` is most frequently used to solve systems of equations ``A*x = b`` with ``F``\ . The returned factorization object ``F`` also supports the methods ``diag``\ , ``det``\ , and ``logdet``\ . You can extract individual factors from ``F`` using ``F[:L]``\ . However, since pivoting is on by default, the factorization is internally represented as ``A == P'*L*D*L'*P`` with a permutation matrix ``P``\ ; using just ``L`` without accounting for ``P`` will give incorrect answers. To include the effects of permutation, it's typically preferable to extact "combined" factors like ``PtL = F[:PtL]`` (the equivalent of ``P'*L``\ ) and ``LtP = F[:UP]`` (the equivalent of ``L'*P``\ ). The complete list of supported factors is ``:L, :PtL, :D, :UP, :U, :LD, :DU, :PtLD, :DUP``\ .

   Setting optional ``shift`` keyword argument computes the factorization of ``A+shift*I`` instead of ``A``\ . If the ``perm`` argument is nonempty, it should be a permutation of ``1:size(A,1)`` giving the ordering to use (instead of CHOLMOD's default AMD ordering).

   ** Note **

   This method uses the CHOLMOD library from SuiteSparse, which only supports doubles or complex doubles. Input matrices not of those element types will be converted to ``SparseMatrixCSC{Float64}`` or ``SparseMatrixCSC{Complex128}`` as appropriate.

   Many other functions from CHOLMOD are wrapped but not exported from the ``Base.SparseArrays.CHOLMOD`` module.

.. function:: ldltfact!(F::Factor, A::Union{SparseMatrixCSC{<:Real},
                  SparseMatrixCSC{Complex{<:Real}},
                  Symmetric{<:Real,SparseMatrixCSC{<:Real,SuiteSparse_long}},
                  Hermitian{Complex{<:Real},SparseMatrixCSC{Complex{<:Real},SuiteSparse_long}}};
                  shift = 0.0) -> CHOLMOD.Factor

   .. Docstring generated from Julia source

   Compute the :math:`LDL'` factorization of ``A``\ , reusing the symbolic factorization ``F``\ .

   ** Note **

   This method uses the CHOLMOD library from SuiteSparse, which only supports doubles or complex doubles. Input matrices not of those element types will be converted to ``SparseMatrixCSC{Float64}`` or ``SparseMatrixCSC{Complex128}`` as appropriate.

.. function:: ldltfact!(::SymTridiagonal) -> LDLt

   .. Docstring generated from Julia source

   Same as ``ldltfact``\ , but saves space by overwriting the input ``A``\ , instead of creating a copy.

.. function:: qr(v::AbstractVector)

   .. Docstring generated from Julia source

   Computes the polar decomposition of a vector.

   Input:

   * ``v::AbstractVector`` - vector to normalize

   Outputs:

   * ``w`` - A unit vector in the direction of ``v``
   * ``r`` - The norm of ``v``

   See also:

   ``normalize``\ , ``normalize!``\ , ``LinAlg.qr!``

.. function:: LinAlg.qr!(v::AbstractVector)

   .. Docstring generated from Julia source

   Computes the polar decomposition of a vector. Instead of returning a new vector as ``qr(v::AbstractVector)``\ , this function mutates the input vector ``v`` in place.

   Input:

   * ``v::AbstractVector`` - vector to normalize

   Outputs:

   * ``w`` - A unit vector in the direction of ``v`` (This is a mutation of ``v``\ ).
   * ``r`` - The norm of ``v``

   See also:

   ``normalize``\ , ``normalize!``\ , ``qr``

.. function:: qr(A [,pivot=Val{false}][;thin=true]) -> Q, R, [p]

   .. Docstring generated from Julia source

   Compute the (pivoted) QR factorization of ``A`` such that either ``A = Q*R`` or ``A[:,p] = Q*R``\ . Also see ``qrfact``\ . The default is to compute a thin factorization. Note that ``R`` is not extended with zeros when the full ``Q`` is requested.

.. function:: qrfact(A [,pivot=Val{false}]) -> F

   .. Docstring generated from Julia source

   Computes the QR factorization of ``A``\ . The return type of ``F`` depends on the element type of ``A`` and whether pivoting is specified (with ``pivot==Val{true}``\ ).

   +-----------------+-------------------+----------------+--------------------------------------+
   | Return type     | ``eltype(A)``     | ``pivot``      | Relationship between ``F`` and ``A`` |
   +=================+===================+================+======================================+
   | ``QR``          | not ``BlasFloat`` | either         | ``A==F[:Q]*F[:R]``                   |
   +-----------------+-------------------+----------------+--------------------------------------+
   | ``QRCompactWY`` | ``BlasFloat``     | ``Val{false}`` | ``A==F[:Q]*F[:R]``                   |
   +-----------------+-------------------+----------------+--------------------------------------+
   | ``QRPivoted``   | ``BlasFloat``     | ``Val{true}``  | ``A[:,F[:p]]==F[:Q]*F[:R]``          |
   +-----------------+-------------------+----------------+--------------------------------------+

   ``BlasFloat`` refers to any of: ``Float32``\ , ``Float64``\ , ``Complex64`` or ``Complex128``\ .

   The individual components of the factorization ``F`` can be accessed by indexing:

   +-----------+-----------------------------------------------+---------------------+------------------------+---------------------+
   | Component | Description                                   | ``QR``              | ``QRCompactWY``        | ``QRPivoted``       |

   +-----------+-----------------------------------------------+---------------------+------------------------+---------------------+

   The following functions are available for the ``QR`` objects: ``size``\ , ``\``\ . When ``A`` is rectangular, ``\`` will return a least squares solution and if the solution is not unique, the one with smallest norm is returned.

   Multiplication with respect to either thin or full ``Q`` is allowed, i.e. both ``F[:Q]*F[:R]`` and ``F[:Q]*A`` are supported. A ``Q`` matrix can be converted into a regular matrix with :func:`full` which has a named argument ``thin``\ .

   **note**

   ``qrfact`` returns multiple types because LAPACK uses several representations that minimize the memory storage requirements of products of Householder elementary reflectors, so that the ``Q`` and ``R`` matrices can be stored compactly rather as two separate dense matrices.

   The data contained in ``QR`` or ``QRPivoted`` can be used to construct the ``QRPackedQ`` type, which is a compact representation of the rotation matrix:

   .. math::

       Q = \prod_{i=1}^{\min(m,n)} (I - \tau_i v_i v_i^T)

   where :math:`\tau_i` is the scale factor and :math:`v_i` is the projection vector associated with the :math:`i^{th}` Householder elementary reflector.

   The data contained in ``QRCompactWY`` can be used to construct the ``QRCompactWYQ`` type, which is a compact representation of the rotation matrix

   .. math::

       Q = I + Y T Y^T

   where ``Y`` is :math:`m \times r` lower trapezoidal and ``T`` is :math:`r \times r` upper triangular. The *compact WY* representation [Schreiber1989]_ is not to be confused with the older, *WY* representation [Bischof1987]_. (The LAPACK documentation uses ``V`` in lieu of ``Y``\ .)

.. function:: qrfact(A) -> SPQR.Factorization

   .. Docstring generated from Julia source

   Compute the QR factorization of a sparse matrix ``A``\ . A fill-reducing permutation is used. The main application of this type is to solve least squares problems with ``\``\ . The function calls the C library SPQR and a few additional functions from the library are wrapped but not exported.

.. function:: qrfact!(A [,pivot=Val{false}])

   .. Docstring generated from Julia source

   ``qrfact!`` is the same as :func:`qrfact` when ``A`` is a subtype of ``StridedMatrix``\ , but saves space by overwriting the input ``A``\ , instead of creating a copy.

.. function:: full(QRCompactWYQ[, thin=true]) -> Matrix

   .. Docstring generated from Julia source

   Converts an orthogonal or unitary matrix stored as a ``QRCompactWYQ`` object, i.e. in the compact WY format [Bischof1987]_, to a dense matrix.

   Optionally takes a ``thin`` Boolean argument, which if ``true`` omits the columns that span the rows of ``R`` in the QR factorization that are zero. The resulting matrix is the ``Q`` in a thin QR factorization (sometimes called the reduced QR factorization). If ``false``\ , returns a ``Q`` that spans all rows of ``R`` in its corresponding QR factorization.

.. function:: bkfact(A) -> BunchKaufman

   .. Docstring generated from Julia source

.. function:: bkfact!(A) -> BunchKaufman

   .. Docstring generated from Julia source

   ``bkfact!`` is the same as :func:`bkfact`\ , but saves space by overwriting the input ``A``\ , instead of creating a copy.

.. function:: eig(A,[irange,][vl,][vu,][permute=true,][scale=true]) -> D, V

   .. Docstring generated from Julia source

   Computes eigenvalues and eigenvectors of ``A``\ . See :func:`eigfact` for details on the ``balance`` keyword argument.

   ``eig`` is a wrapper around :func:`eigfact`\ , extracting all parts of the factorization to a tuple; where possible, using :func:`eigfact` is recommended.

.. function:: eigvals(A,[irange,][vl,][vu]) -> values

   .. Docstring generated from Julia source

   Returns the eigenvalues of ``A``\ . If ``A`` is ``Symmetric``\ , ``Hermitian`` or ``SymTridiagonal``\ , it is possible to calculate only a subset of the eigenvalues by specifying either a ``UnitRange`` ``irange`` covering indices of the sorted eigenvalues, or a pair ``vl`` and ``vu`` for the lower and upper boundaries of the eigenvalues.

   For general non-symmetric matrices it is possible to specify how the matrix is balanced before the eigenvector calculation. The option ``permute=true`` permutes the matrix to become closer to upper triangular, and ``scale=true`` scales the matrix by its diagonal elements to make rows and columns moreequal in norm. The default is ``true`` for both options.

.. function:: svdfact(A, [thin=true]) -> SVD

   .. Docstring generated from Julia source

   Compute the singular value decomposition (SVD) of ``A`` and return an ``SVD`` object.

   ``U``\ , ``S``\ , ``V`` and ``Vt`` can be obtained from the factorization ``F`` with ``F[:U]``\ , ``F[:S]``\ , ``F[:V]`` and ``F[:Vt]``\ , such that ``A = U*diagm(S)*Vt``\ . The algorithm produces ``Vt`` and hence ``Vt`` is more efficient to extract than ``V``\ .

   If ``thin=true`` (default), a thin SVD is returned. For a :math:`M \times N` matrix ``A``\ , ``U`` is :math:`M \times M` for a full SVD (``thin=false``\ ) and :math:`M \times \min(M, N)` for a thin SVD.

.. function:: svdfact!(A, [thin=true]) -> SVD

   ``svd`` is a wrapper around :func:`svdfact(A)`\ , extracting all parts of the ``SVD`` factorization to a tuple. Direct use of ``svdfact`` is therefore more efficient.

   ``K+L`` is the effective numerical rank of the matrix ``[A; B]``\ .

   The entries of ``F[:D1]`` and ``F[:D2]`` are related, as explained in the LAPACK documentation for the `generalized SVD <http://www.netlib.org/lapack/lug/node36.html>`_ and the `xGGSVD3 <http://www.netlib.org/lapack/explore-html/d6/db3/dggsvd3_8f.html>`_ routine which is called underneath (in LAPACK 3.6.0 and newer).

The ``Givens`` type supports left multiplication ``G*A`` and conjugated transpose right multiplication ``A*G'``\ .

   If ``A`` is a matrix and ``b`` is a vector, then ``scale!(A,b)`` scales each column ``i`` of ``A`` by ``b[i]`` (similar to ``A*Diagonal(b)``\ ), while ``scale!(b,A)`` scales each row ``i`` of ``A`` by ``b[i]`` (similar to ``Diagonal(b)*A``\ ), again operating in-place on ``A``\ .

.. function:: Tridiagonal(dl, d, du)

   .. Docstring generated from Julia source

   .. Docstring generated from Julia source

   Compute the ``p``\ -norm of a vector or the operator norm of a matrix ``A``\ , defaulting to the ``p=2``\ -norm.

   For vectors, ``p`` can assume any numeric value (even though not all values produce a mathematically valid vector norm). In particular, ``norm(A, Inf)`` returns the largest value in ``abs(A)``\ , whereas ``norm(A, -Inf)`` returns the smallest.

   For matrices, the matrix norm induced by the vector ``p``\ -norm is used, where valid values of ``p`` are ``1``\ , ``2``\ , or ``Inf``\ . (Note that for sparse matrices, ``p=2`` is currently not implemented.) Use :func:`vecnorm` to compute the Frobenius norm.

   For any iterable container ``A`` (including arrays of any dimension) of numbers (or any element type for which ``norm`` is defined), compute the ``p``\ -norm (defaulting to ``p=2``\ ) as if ``A`` were a vector of the corresponding length.

   For example, if ``A`` is a matrix and ``p=2``\ , then this is equivalent to the Frobenius norm.

   Skeel condition number :math:`\kappa_S` of the matrix ``M``\ , optionally with respect to the vector ``x``\ , as computed using the operator ``p``\ -norm. ``p`` is ``Inf`` by default, if not provided. Valid values for ``p`` are ``1``\ , ``2``\ , or ``Inf``\ .

   This quantity is also known in the literature as the Bauer condition number, relative condition number, or componentwise relative condition number.

.. function:: logdet(M)

.. function:: logabsdet(M)

   .. Docstring generated from Julia source

   Log of absolute value of determinant of real matrix. Equivalent to ``(log(abs(det(M))), sign(det(M)))``\ , but may provide increased accuracy and/or speed.

.. function:: inv(M)

   .. Docstring generated from Julia source

   Matrix inverse.

.. function:: pinv(M[, tol])

   .. Docstring generated from Julia source

   Computes the Moore-Penrose pseudoinverse.

   For matrices ``M`` with floating point elements, it is convenient to compute the pseudoinverse by inverting only singular values above a given threshold, ``tol``\ .

   The optimal choice of ``tol`` varies both with the value of ``M`` and the intended application of the pseudoinverse. The default value of ``tol`` is ``eps(real(float(one(eltype(M)))))*maximum(size(A))``\ , which is essentially machine epsilon for the real part of a matrix element multiplied by the larger matrix dimension. For inverting dense ill-conditioned matrices in a least-squares sense, ``tol = sqrt(eps(real(float(one(eltype(M))))))`` is recommended.

   .. Docstring generated from Julia source

   Perform linear regression. Returns ``a`` and ``b`` such that ``a + b*x`` is the closest straight line to the given points ``(x, y)``\ , i.e., such that the squared error between ``y`` and ``a + b*x`` is minimized.

   **Example**:

   .. code-block:: julia

       using PyPlot
       x = [1.0:12.0;]
       y = [5.5, 6.3, 7.6, 8.8, 10.9, 11.79, 13.48, 15.02, 17.77, 20.81, 22.0, 22.99]
       a, b = linreg(x, y)          # Linear regression
       plot(x, y, "o")              # Plot (x, y) points

   .. math::

       e^A = \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} \frac{A^n}{n!}.

   For symmetric or Hermitian ``A``\ , an eigendecomposition (:func:`eigfact`\ ) is used, otherwise the scaling and squaring algorithm (see [H05]_) is chosen.

   .. [H05] Nicholas J. Higham, "The squaring and scaling method for the matrix exponential revisited", SIAM Journal on Matrix Analysis and Applications, 26(4), 2005, 1179-1193. `doi:10.1137/090768539 <http://dx.doi.org/10.1137/090768539>`_

.. function:: logm(A::StridedMatrix)

   .. Docstring generated from Julia source

   If ``A`` has no negative real eigenvalue, compute the principal matrix logarithm of ``A``\ , i.e. the unique matrix :math:`X` such that :math:`e^X = A` and :math:`-\pi < Im(\lambda) < \pi` for all the eigenvalues :math:`\lambda` of :math:`X`\ . If ``A`` has nonpositive eigenvalues, a nonprincipal matrix function is returned whenever possible.

   If ``A`` is symmetric or Hermitian, its eigendecomposition (:func:`eigfact`\ ) is used, if ``A`` is triangular an improved version of the inverse scaling and squaring method is employed (see [AH12]_ and [AHR13]_). For general matrices, the complex Schur form (:func:`schur`\ ) is computed and the triangular algorithm is used on the triangular factor.

.. function:: sqrtm(A)

   .. Docstring generated from Julia source

   If ``A`` has no negative real eigenvalues, compute the principal matrix square root of ``A``\ , that is the unique matrix :math:`X` with eigenvalues having positive real part such that :math:`X^2 = A`\ . Otherwise, a nonprincipal square root is returned.

   If ``A`` is symmetric or Hermitian, its eigendecomposition (:func:`eigfact`\ ) is used to compute the square root. Otherwise, the square root is determined by means of the Björck-Hammarling method, which computes the complex Schur form (:func:`schur`\ ) and then the complex square root of the triangular factor.

   .. Docstring generated from Julia source

   Computes eigenvalues ``d`` of ``A`` using implicitly restarted Lanczos or Arnoldi iterations for real symmetric or general nonsymmetric matrices respectively.

   The following keyword arguments are supported:

   * ``nev``\ : Number of eigenvalues
   * ``ncv``\ : Number of Krylov vectors used in the computation; should satisfy ``nev+1 <= ncv <= n``   for real symmetric problems and ``nev+2 <= ncv <= n`` for other problems, where ``n`` is the   size of the input matrix ``A``\ . The default is ``ncv = max(20,2*nev+1)``\ . Note that these   restrictions limit the input matrix ``A`` to be of dimension at least 2.
   * ``which``\ : type of eigenvalues to compute. See the note below.

   * ``tol``\ : parameter defining the relative tolerance for convergence of Ritz values (eigenvalue estimates).      A Ritz value :math:`θ` is considered converged when its associated residual      is less than or equal to the product of ``tol`` and :math:`max(ɛ^{2/3}, |θ|)`\ ,      where ``ɛ = eps(real(eltype(A)))/2`` is LAPACK's machine epsilon.      The residual associated with :math:`θ` and its corresponding Ritz vector :math:`v`      is defined as the norm :math:`||Av - vθ||`\ .      The specified value of ``tol`` should be positive; otherwise, it is ignored      and :math:`ɛ` is used instead.      Default: :math:`ɛ`\ .

   * ``maxiter``\ : Maximum number of iterations (default = 300)
   * ``sigma``\ : Specifies the level shift used in inverse iteration. If ``nothing`` (default),   defaults to ordinary (forward) iterations. Otherwise, find eigenvalues close to ``sigma``   using shift and invert iterations.
   * ``ritzvec``\ : Returns the Ritz vectors ``v`` (eigenvectors) if ``true``
   * ``v0``\ : starting vector from which to start the iterations

   ``eigs`` returns the ``nev`` requested eigenvalues in ``d``\ , the corresponding Ritz vectors ``v`` (only if ``ritzvec=true``\ ), the number of converged eigenvalues ``nconv``\ , the number of iterations ``niter`` and the number of matrix vector multiplications ``nmult``\ , as well as the final residual vector ``resid``\ .

   **note**

   The ``sigma`` and ``which`` keywords interact: the description of eigenvalues searched for by ``which`` do _not_ necessarily refer to the eigenvalues of ``A``\ , but rather the linear operator constructed by the specification of the iteration mode implied by ``sigma``\ .

   +-----------------+------------------------------------+------------------------------------+
   | real or complex | inverse with level shift ``sigma`` | :math:`(A - \sigma I )^{-1}`       |
   +-----------------+------------------------------------+------------------------------------+

   **note**

   Although ``tol`` has a default value, the best choice depends strongly on the matrix ``A``\ . We recommend that users _always_ specify a value for ``tol`` which suits their specific needs.

   * ``tol``\ : relative tolerance used in the convergence criterion for eigenvalues, similar to      ``tol`` in the :func:`eigs` method for the ordinary eigenvalue      problem, but effectively for the eigenvalues of :math:`B^{-1} A` instead of :math:`A`\ .      See the documentation for the ordinary eigenvalue problem in      :func:`eigs` and the accompanying note about ``tol``\ .

   * ``ritzvec``\ : Returns the Ritz vectors ``v`` (eigenvectors) if ``true``
   * ``v0``\ : starting vector from which to start the iterations

.. function:: svds(A; nsv=6, ritzvec=true, tol=0.0, maxiter=1000) -> ([left_sv,] s, [right_sv,] nconv, niter, nmult, resid)

   .. Docstring generated from Julia source

   Computes the largest singular values ``s`` of ``A`` using implicitly restarted Lanczos iterations derived from :func:`eigs`\ .

   **Inputs**

   * ``A``\ : Linear operator whose singular values are desired. ``A`` may be represented   as a subtype of ``AbstractArray``\ , e.g., a sparse matrix, or any other type   supporting the four methods ``size(A)``\ , ``eltype(A)``\ , ``A * vector``\ , and   ``A' * vector``\ .
   * ``nsv``\ : Number of singular values.
   * ``ritzvec``\ : If ``true``\ , return the left and right singular vectors ``left_sv`` and ``right_sv``\ .    If ``false``\ , omit the singular vectors. Default: ``true``\ .
   * ``tol``\ : tolerance, see :func:`eigs`\ .
   * ``maxiter``\ : Maximum number of iterations, see :func:`eigs`\ .

   **Outputs**

   * ``left_sv``\ : Left singular vectors (only if ``ritzvec = true``\ ).
   * ``s``\ : A vector of length ``nsv`` containing the requested singular values.
   * ``right_sv``\ : Right singular vectors (only if ``ritzvec = true``\ ).
   * ``nconv``\ : Number of converged singular values.
   * ``niter``\ : Number of iterations.
   * ``nmult``\ : Number of matrix–vector products used.
   * ``resid``\ : Final residual vector.

   **Example**

   .. code-block:: julia

       X = sprand(10, 5, 0.2)
       svds(X, nsv = 2)

   **Implementation note**

   ``svds(A)`` is formally equivalent to calling ``eigs`` to perform implicitly restarted Lanczos tridiagonalization on the Hermitian matrix :math:`\begin{pmatrix} 0 & A^\prime \\ A & 0 \end{pmatrix}`\ , whose eigenvalues are plus and minus the singular values of :math:`A`\ .

.. function:: peakflops(n; parallel=false)

   .. Docstring generated from Julia source

   ``peakflops`` computes the peak flop rate of the computer by using double precision :func:`Base.LinAlg.BLAS.gemm!`\ . By default, if no arguments are specified, it multiplies a matrix of size ``n x n``\ , where ``n = 2000``\ . If the underlying BLAS is using multiple threads, higher flop rates are realized. The number of BLAS threads can be set with ``blas_set_num_threads(n)``\ .

   If the keyword argument ``parallel`` is set to ``true``\ , ``peakflops`` is run in parallel on all the worker processors. The flop rate of the entire parallel computer is returned. When running in parallel, only 1 BLAS thread is used. The argument ``n`` still refers to the size of the problem that is solved on each processor.

LAPACK Functions
----------------

.. module:: Base.LinAlg.LAPACK

:mod:`Base.LinAlg.LAPACK` provides wrappers for some of the LAPACK functions for
linear algebra.  Those functions that overwrite one of the input
arrays have names ending in ``'!'``.

Usually a function has 4 methods defined, one each for ``Float64``,
``Float32``, ``Complex128`` and ``Complex64`` arrays.

Note that the LAPACK API provided by Julia can and will change in the future. Since
this API is not user-facing, there is no commitment to support/deprecate this specific
set of functions in future releases.
