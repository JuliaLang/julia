:mod:`glpk.jl` --- Wrapper for the GNU Linear Programming Kit (GLPK)
======================================================================

.. module:: glpk.jl
   :synopsis: GLPK wrapper

This module provides a wrapper for the GNU Linear Programming Kit (`GLPK <http://www.gnu.org/software/glpk>`_),
which is a C library, in Julia.
It is designed for making it easy to port C code to Julia, while at the same time having the
benefits of the higher level language features of Julia, like the automatic management of memory, the possibility
of returning tuples/strings/vectors etc.

It's currently based on GLPK version 4.47.

Preamble
--------

Almost all GLPK functions can be called in Julia with the same syntax as in the original C library,
with some simple translation rules (with very :ref:`few exceptions <glpk-different-than-C>`).
Some functionality is still missing (see :ref:`this list <glpk-not-available>`); most of it will be
added in the future.

Let's start with an example. This is an excerpt from the beginning of the :file:`sample.c` example program
which ships with GLPK:

.. code-block:: c

    /* C code */
    glp_prob *lp = glp_create_prob();
    glp_set_prob_name(lp, "sample");
    glp_set_obj_dir(lp, GLP_MAX);
    glp_add_rows(lp, 3);
    glp_set_row_name(lp, 1, "p");
    glp_set_row_bnds(lp, 1, GLP_UP, 0.0, 100.0);

This is the Julia translation of the above::

    # Julia code
    lp = GLPProb()
    glp_set_prob_name(lp, "sample")
    glp_set_obj_dir(lp, GLP_MAX)
    glp_add_rows(lp, 3)
    glp_set_row_name(lp, 1, "p")
    glp_set_row_bnds(lp, 1, GLP_UP, 0.0, 100.0)

Apart from the first line, which is different, all the rest is pretty much unchanged.
In particular, note that the GLPK constants, such as ``GLP_MAX`` and ``GLP_UP``, are available, unchanged,
within Julia (at the moment they are integer values, like in C, but this may change in the future).

Because of the strict adherence of the Julia functions to their C counterparts, and since the GLPK
documentation is extremely well written and complete, this manual page is not going to document
the whole GLPK library in detail, but rather provide :ref:`the rules <glpk-translation-rules>` needed to translate
from C to Julia, detail the :ref:`few exceptions <glpk-different-than-C>` to these rules and then
:ref:`list all the available functions <glpk-function-list>` with a brief description of their
usage.

Please, refer to the original GLPK manual (available at http://www.gnu.org/software/glpk) for a detailed
description of the library API.

.. _glpk-translation-rules:

--------------------------------------
GLPK translation rules from C to Julia
--------------------------------------

1) from C stucts to Julia objects
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

All structs in the original GLPK are wrapped up in composite types, which initialize and destroy themselves
as needed. For example, the ``glp_prob`` C struct becomes the ``GLPProb`` Julia type.
Whenever in C you would pass a pointer to a struct, in Julia you pass a corresponding composite object.
This is the table relating C structs with Julia types:

+---------------+--------------------------+
|  C            |  Julia                   |
+===============+==========================+
| ``glp_prob``  | ``GLPProb``              |
+---------------+--------------------------+
| ``glp_smcp``  | ``GLPSimplexParam``      |
+---------------+--------------------------+
| ``glp_iptcp`` | ``GLPInteriorParam``     |
+---------------+--------------------------+
| ``glp_iocp``  | ``GLPIntoptParam``       |
+---------------+--------------------------+
| ``glp_bfcp``  | ``GLPBasisFactParam``    |
+---------------+--------------------------+
| ``glp_tran``  | ``GLPMathProgWorkspace`` |
+---------------+--------------------------+
| ``glp_data``  | ``GLPData``              |
+---------------+--------------------------+

Therefore, the original C GLPK API:

.. code-block:: c

    int glp_simplex(glp_prob * lp, glp_smpc * param)

becomes::

    glp_simplex(lp::GLPProb, param::GLPSimplexParam)

In the C GLPK API, objects are created by functions, such as:

.. code-block:: c

    glp_prob * lp = glp_create_prob();
    glp_smcp * param = glp_smcp_init();

and need to be destroyed when the program is finished:

.. code-block:: c

    glp_delete_prob(lp);
    glp_smcp_delete(smcp);

In Julia, objects are created by calling the object constructor (without parameters)::

    lp = GLPProb()
    param = GLPSimplexParam()

and they are automatically destroyed by the garbage collector when no longer needed.


2) setting the parameters to the solvers
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In all GLPK solver functions, like ``glp_simplex``, options are passed via structs. As stated before, these become
composite object types in Julia; but instead of setting a field, like in C:

.. code-block:: c

    param = glp_smcp_init();
    param.msg_lev = GLP_MSG_ERR;
    param.presolve = GLP_ON;

in Julia one uses an array-like referencing syntax::

    param = GLPSimplexParam()
    param["msg_lev"]= GLP_MSG_ERR
    param["presolve"] = GLP_ON

Note that the field names are passed as strings, and that all GLPK constants are available in Julia.
Also note that no test is currently performed at assignment to check that the provided values are valid.

This part of the API may change in the future.


3) scalar and array types translate in a natural way
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The following C-to-Julia type conversion rules apply:

+--------------+-------------+
| C            | Julia       |
+==============+=============+
| ``int``      | ``Int32``   |
+--------------+-------------+
| ``double``   | ``Float64`` |
+--------------+-------------+
| ``char[]``   | ``String``  |
+--------------+-------------+
| ``glp_long`` | ``Int64``   |
+--------------+-------------+

On output, these rules apply exactly. On input, on the other hand, Julia requirements are more relaxed:

+--------------+-------------+
| C            | Julia       |
+==============+=============+
| ``int``      | ``Integer`` |
+--------------+-------------+
| ``glp_long`` | ``Integer`` |
+--------------+-------------+
| ``double``   | ``Real``    |
+--------------+-------------+

Whenever the C version expects a pointer to an array, a Julia Array can be passed. In the GLPK API, all indexing
starts from 1 even in the C version, so no special care is required on that side (in C, you would leave an
unused element at the beginning of each array; in Julia you don't).

The relaxed requirements for inputs are also valid for arrays (e.g. one can pass an ``Array{Int64}`` when an array
of ``int`` is expected, and it will be converted automatically). The only exception is for functions which
return an array of values by filling out an allocated array whose pointer is provided by the user.
In that case, the strict version of the rules applies (i.e. you can only pass an ``Array{Int32}`` if an
array of ``int`` is expected). Those functions almost always have an alternative, more convenient formulation
as well, though.


4) optional arguments
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Whenever the C version accepts the value ``NULL`` to indicate an optional pointer argument, the Julia version
accepts the constant ``nothing``. In case the optional pointer argument is an array, an empty array is
also accepted (it can be of the expected type, e.g. ``Int32[]``, or even just ``[]``)
Most of the time, alternative ways to call the function are also provided.


5) fatal errors become exceptions
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Whenever an invalid condition is detected (e.g. if you pass an invalid parameter, such as a negative length),
the Julia GLPK wrapper throws a ``GLPError`` exception with some message detailing what went wrong.
Ideally, all invalid input combinations should be captured by Julia before being passed
over to the library, so that all errors could be catched via a ``try ... catch`` block;
in practice, it is likely that some conditions exist which will leak to the C API and break Julia: this should be
considered as a bug (and reported as such).

.. _glpk-not-available:

---------------------------------------------------
GLPK functions which are not avaliable yet in Julia
---------------------------------------------------

In general, all parts of the GLPK API which rely on callback functions are not avaliable in Julia.
In particular, you should not set the callback fields (``cb_func`` and ``cb_info``) in the ``GLPIntoptParam``
type, unless you *really* know what you're doing.

There are 5 groups of functions which are not wrapped:

1. The branch & cut API function for mixed integer programming, because they are supposed to be called from
   within a callback (see chapter 5 in the GLPK manual); they all start with this prefix:

   * ``glp_ios_*``

2. All graph and network routines (anything involving ``glp_graph`` objects); these will be added in the future)

3. Some misc functions which either have a variable argument list or involve callbacks (see section 6.1 in the GLPK
   manual):

   * ``glp_printf``
   * ``glp_vprintf``
   * ``glp_term_hook``
   * ``glp_error``
   * ``glp_assert``
   * ``glp_error_hook``

4. Some plain data file reading routines which involve long jumps / varargs (see section 6.2 in the GLPK manual):

   * ``glp_sdf_set_jump``
   * ``glp_sdf_error``
   * ``glp_sdf_warning``


5. One additional routine, which may be included in the future:

   * ``lpx_check_kkt``

.. _glpk-different-than-C:

------------------------------------------------
Functions which differ from their C counterparts
------------------------------------------------

Some library functions return multiple values; as C cannot do this directly, this is obtained via some "pointer gymnastics".
In Julia, on the other hand, this is not necessary, and providing an exact counterpart to the C version would be awkward and
pointless. There are 3 such functions:

    * ``glp_analyze_bound``
    * ``glp_analyze_coef``
    * ``glp_mem_usage``

For example the C declaration for ``glp_analyze_bound`` is:

.. code-block:: c

    void glp_analyze_bound(glp_prob *lp, int k, int *limit1, int *var1, int *limit2, int *var2)

In Julia, this becomes::

    glp_analyze_bound(glp_prob::GLPProb, k::Integer)

which returns a tuple::

    julia> (limit1, var1, limit2, var2) = glp_analyze_bound(glp_prob, k)
    
The other 2 functions work in the same way, by just returning the values which in C you would pass
as pointers.

Some other functions have both a strictly-compatible calling form, for simplifying C code porting,
and some more convenient Julia counterparts. See :ref:`the list below <glpk-function-list>` for more details.

One function has a different return value: ``glp_version`` returns a tuple of integer with the major and minor
version numbers, rather then a string.

.. _glpk-function-list:

-------------------------------
List of GLPK functions in Julia
-------------------------------

As stated above, this list only offers a brief explanation of what each function does and presents alternative
calling forms when available. Refer to the GLPK manual for a complete description.

.. function:: glp_set_prob_name(glp_prob, name)

    Assigns a name to the problem object (or deletes it if ``name`` is empty or ``nothing``).

.. function:: glp_set_obj_name(glp_prob, name)

    Assigns a name to the objective function (or deletes it if ``name`` is empty or ``nothing``).

.. function:: glp_set_obj_dir(glp_prob, dir)

    Sets the optimization direction, ``GLP_MIN`` (minimization) or ``GLP_MAX`` (maximization).

.. function:: glp_add_rows(glp_prob, rows)

    Adds the given number of rows (constraints) to the problem object; returns the number of
    the first new row added.

.. function:: glp_add_cols(glp_prob, cols)

    Adds the given number of columns (structural variables) to the problem object; returns the number of
    the first new column added.

.. function:: glp_set_row_name(glp_prob, row, name)

    Assigns a name to the specified row (or deletes it if ``name`` is empty or ``nothing``).

.. function:: glp_set_col_name(glp_prob, col, name)

    Assigns a name to the specified column (or deletes it if ``name`` is empty or ``nothing``).

.. function:: glp_set_row_bnds(glp_prob, row, bounds_type, lb, ub)

    Sets the type and bounds on a row. ``type`` must be one of ``GLP_FR`` (free), ``GLP_LO`` (lower bounded),
    ``GLP_UP`` (upper bounded), ``GLP_DB`` (double bounded), ``GLP_FX`` (fixed).

    At initialization, each row is free.

.. function:: glp_set_col_bnds(glp_prob, col, bounds_type, lb, ub)

    Sets the type and bounds on a column. ``type`` must be one of ``GLP_FR`` (free), ``GLP_LO`` (lower bounded),
    ``GLP_UP`` (upper bounded), ``GLP_DB`` (double bounded), ``GLP_FX`` (fixed).

    At initialization, each column is fixed at 0.

.. function:: glp_set_obj_coef(glp_prob, col, coef)

    Sets the objective coefficient to a column (``col`` can be 0 to indicate the constant term of the objective function).

.. function:: glp_set_mat_row(glp_prob, row, [len,] ind, val)

    Sets (replaces) the content of a row. The content is specified in sparse format: ``ind`` is a vector of indices,
    ``val`` is the vector of corresponding values. ``len`` is the number of vector elements which will be considered,
    and must be less or equal to the length of both ``ind`` and ``val``.  If ``len`` is 0, ``ind`` and/or ``val`` can be ``nothing``.

    In Julia, ``len`` can be omitted, and then it is inferred from ``ind`` and ``val`` (which need to have the same length
    in such case).

.. function:: glp_set_mat_col(glp_prob, col, [len,] ind, val)

    Sets (replaces) the content of a column. Everything else is like ``glp_set_mat_row``.

.. function:: glp_load_matrix(glp_prob, [numel,] ia, ja, ar)
              glp_load_matrix(glp_prob, A)

    Sets (replaces) the content matrix (i.e. sets all  rows/coluns at once). The matrix is passed in sparse
    format.

    In the first form (original C API), it's passed via 3 vectors: ``ia`` and ``ja`` are for rows/columns
    indices, ``ar`` is for values. ``numel`` is the number of elements which will be read and must be less or
    equal to the length of any of the 3 vectors. If ``numel`` is 0, any of the vectors can be passed as ``nothing``.

    In Julia, ``numel`` can be omitted, and then it is inferred from ``ia``, ``ja`` and ``ar`` (which need to have the same length
    in such case).

    Also, in Julia there's a second, simpler calling form, in which the matrix is passed as a ``SparseMatrixCSC`` object.

.. function:: glp_check_dup(rows, cols, [numel,] ia, ja)

    Check for duplicates in the indices vectors ``ia`` and ``ja``. ``numel`` has the same meaning and (optional) use as in
    ``glp_load_matrix``. Returns 0 if no duplicates/out-of-range indices are found, or a positive number indicating where a duplicate
    occurs, or a negative number indicating an out-of-bounds index.

.. function:: glp_sort_matrix(glp_prob)

    Sorts the elements of the problem object's matrix.

.. function:: glp_del_rows(glp_prob, [num_rows,] rows_ids)

    Deletes rows from the problem object. Rows are specified in the ``rows_ids`` vector. ``num_rows`` is the number of elements
    of ``rows_ids`` which will be considered, and must be less or equal to the length id ``rows_ids``. If ``num_rows`` is 0, ``rows_ids``
    can be ``nothing``. In Julia, ``num_rows`` is optional (it's inferred from ``rows_ids`` if not given).

.. function:: glp_del_cols(glp_prob, cols_ids)

    Deletes columns from the problem object. See ``glp_del_rows``.

.. function:: glp_copy_prob(glp_prob_dest, glp_prob, copy_names)

    Makes a copy of the problem object. The flag ``copy_names`` determines if names are copied, and must be either ``GLP_ON`` or ``GLP_OFF``.

.. function:: glp_erase_prob(glp_prob)

    Resets the problem object.

.. function:: glp_get_prob_name(glp_prob)

    Returns the problem object's name. Unlike the C version, if the problem has no assigned name, returns an empty string.

.. function:: glp_get_obj_name(glp_prob)

    Returns the objective function's name. Unlike the C version, if the objective has no assigned name, returns an empty string.

.. function:: glp_get_obj_dir(glp_prob)

    Returns the optimization direction, ``GLP_MIN`` (minimization) or ``GLP_MAX`` (maximization).

.. function:: glp_get_num_rows(glp_prob)

    Returns the current number of rows.

.. function:: glp_get_num_cols(glp_prob)

    Returns the current number of columns.

.. function:: glp_get_row_name(glp_prob, row)

    Returns the name of the specified row. Unlike the C version, if the row has no assigned name, returns an empty string.

.. function:: glp_get_col_name(glp_prob, col)

    Returns the name of the specified column. Unlike the C version, if the column has no assigned name, returns an empty string.

.. function:: glp_get_row_type(glp_prob, row)

    Returns the type of the specified row: ``GLP_FR`` (free), ``GLP_LO`` (lower bounded),
    ``GLP_UP`` (upper bounded), ``GLP_DB`` (double bounded), ``GLP_FX`` (fixed).

.. function:: glp_get_row_lb(glp_prob, row)

    Returns the lower bound of the specified row, ``-DBL_MAX`` if unbounded.

.. function:: glp_get_row_ub(glp_prob, row)

    Returns the upper bound of the specified row, ``+DBL_MAX`` if unbounded.

.. function:: glp_get_col_type(glp_prob, col)

    Returns the type of the specified column: ``GLP_FR`` (free), ``GLP_LO`` (lower bounded),
    ``GLP_UP`` (upper bounded), ``GLP_DB`` (double bounded), ``GLP_FX`` (fixed).

.. function:: glp_get_col_lb(glp_prob, col)

    Returns the lower bound of the specified column, ``-DBL_MAX`` if unbounded.

.. function:: glp_get_col_ub(glp_prob, col)

    Returns the upper bound of the specified column, ``+DBL_MAX`` if unbounded.

.. function:: glp_get_obj_coef(glp_prob, col)

    Return the objective coefficient to a column (``col`` can be 0 to indicate the constant term of the objective function).

.. function:: glp_get_num_nz(glp_prob)

    Return the number of non-zero elements in the constraint matrix.

.. function:: glp_get_mat_row(glp_prob, row, ind, val)
              glp_get_mat_row(glp_prob, row)

    Returns the contents of a row. In the first form (original C API), it fills the ``ind`` and ``val`` vectors provided,
    which must be of type ``Vector{Int32}`` and ``Vector{Float64}`` respectively, and have a sufficient length to hold the result
    (or they can be empty or ``nothing``, and then they're not filled). It returns the length of the result.

    In Julia, there's a second, simpler calling form which allocates and returns the two vectors as ``(ind, val)``.

.. function:: glp_get_mat_col(glp_prob, col, ind, val)
              glp_get_mat_col(glp_prob, col)

    Returns the contents of a column. See ``glp_get_mat_row``.

.. function:: glp_create_index(glp_prob)

    Creates the name index (used by ``glp_find_row``, ``glp_find_col``) for the problem object.

.. function:: glp_find_row(glp_prob, name)

    Finds the numeric id of a row by name. Returns 0 if no row with the given name is found.

.. function:: glp_find_col(glp_prob, name)

    Returns the sjj scale factor for the specified column.

.. function:: glp_scale_prob(glp_prob, flags)

    Performs automatic scaling of problem data for the problem object. The parameter ``flags`` can be ``GLP_SF_AUTO`` (automatic)
    or a bitwise OR of the forllowing: ``GLP_SF_GM`` (geometric mean), ``GLP_SF_EQ`` (equilibration), ``GLP_SF_2N`` (nearest power of 2),
    ``GLP_SF_SKIP`` (skip if well scaled).

.. function:: glp_unscale_prob(glp_prob)

    Unscale the problem data (cancels the scaling effect).

.. function:: glp_set_row_stat(glp_prob, row, stat)

    Sets the status of the specified row. ``stat`` must be one of: ``GLP_BS`` (basic), ``GLP_NL`` (non-basic lower bounded),

.. function:: glp_cpx_basis(glp_prob)

    Constructs an initial LP basis for the problem object with the algorithm proposed by R. Bixby.

.. function:: glp_simplex(glp_prob, [glp_param])

    The routine ``glp_simplex`` is a driver to the LP solver based on the simplex
    method. This routine retrieves problem data from the specified problem
    object, calls the solver to solve the problem instance, and stores results of
    computations back into the problem object.

    The parameters are specified via the optional ``glp_param`` argument, which is of type ``GLPSimplexParam``
    (or ``nothing`` to use the default settings).

    Returns 0 in case of success, or a non-zero flag specifying the reason for failure: ``GLP_EBADB`` (invalid base),
    ``GLP_ESING`` (singular matrix), ``GLP_ECOND`` (ill-conditioned matrix), ``GLP_EBOUND`` (incorrect bounds),

    solution), ``GLP_ENODFS`` (no dual feasible solution).

.. function:: glp_exact(glp_prob, [glp_param])

    A tentative implementation of the primal two-phase simplex method based on exact (rational) arithmetic. Similar to
    ``glp_simplex``. The optional glp_param is of type ``GLPSimplexParam``.

    The possible return values are 0 (success) or ``GLP_EBADB``, ``GLP_ESING``, ``GLP_EBOUND``,
    ``GLP_EFAIL``, ``GLP_ITLIM``, ``GLP_ETLIM`` (see ``glp_simplex``).

.. function:: glp_init_smcp(glp_param)

    function can be used to reset the object.

.. function:: glp_get_status(glp_prob)

    Returns the generic status of the current basic solution: ``GLP_OPT`` (optimal),
    ``GLP_FEAS`` (feasible), ``GLP_INFEAS`` (infeasible), ``GLP_NOFEAS`` (no feasible solution), ``GLP_UNBND``
    (unbounded solution), ``GLP_UNDEF`` (undefined).

.. function:: glp_get_prim_stat(glp_prob)

    Returns the dual value (reduced cost) of the specified column.

.. function:: glp_get_unbnd_ray(glp_prob)

    Returns the number k of a variable, which causes primal or dual unboundedness (if 1 <= k <= rows
    it's row k; if rows+1 <= k <= rows+cols it's column k-rows, if k=0 such variable is not defined).

.. function:: glp_interior(glp_prob, [glp_param])

    The routine ``glp_interior`` is a driver to the LP solver based on the primal-dual
    interior-point method. This routine retrieves problem data from the

    the vector). ``len`` is the number of elements which will be considered and must be smaller or equal to the length of
    both ``ind`` and ``val``; in Julia, it can be omitted (and then ``ind`` and ``val`` must have the same length).
