.. function:: ccall((symbol, library) or function_pointer, ReturnType, (ArgumentType1, ...), ArgumentValue1, ...)

   .. Docstring generated from Julia source

       ccall((symbol, library) or function_pointer, ReturnType, (ArgumentType1, ...), ArgumentValue1, ...)

   Call function in C-exported shared library, specified by ``(function name, library)`` tuple, where each component is an AbstractString or :Symbol.

   Note that the argument type tuple must be a literal tuple, and not a tuple-valued variable or expression. Alternatively, ccall may also be used to call a function pointer, such as one returned by dlsym.

   Each ``ArgumentValue`` to the ``ccall`` will be converted to the corresponding ``ArgumentType``\ , by automatic insertion of calls to ``unsafe_convert(ArgumentType, cconvert(ArgumentType, ArgumentValue))``\ . (see also the documentation for each of these functions for further details). In most cases, this simply results in a call to ``convert(ArgumentType, ArgumentValue)``

.. function:: cglobal((symbol, library) [, type=Void])

   .. Docstring generated from Julia source

       cglobal((symbol, library) [, type=Void])

   Obtain a pointer to a global variable in a C-exported shared library, specified exactly as in ``ccall``\ . Returns a ``Ptr{Type}``\ , defaulting to ``Ptr{Void}`` if no Type argument is supplied. The values can be read or written by ``unsafe_load`` or ``unsafe_store!``\ , respectively.

.. function:: cfunction(function::Function, ReturnType::Type, (ArgumentTypes...))

   .. Docstring generated from Julia source

       cfunction(function::Function, ReturnType::Type, (ArgumentTypes...))

   Generate C-callable function pointer from Julia function. Type annotation of the return value in the callback function is a must for situations where Julia cannot infer the return type automatically.

   For example:

       function foo()
           # body

           retval::Float64
       end

       bar = cfunction(foo, Float64, ())

.. function:: unsafe_convert(T,x)

   .. Docstring generated from Julia source

       unsafe_convert(T,x)

   Convert "x" to a value of type "T"

   In cases where ``convert`` would need to take a Julia object and turn it into a ``Ptr``\ , this function should be used to define and perform that conversion.

   Be careful to ensure that a julia reference to ``x`` exists as long as the result of this function will be used. Accordingly, the argument ``x`` to this function should never be an expression, only a variable name or field reference. For example, ``x=a.b.c`` is acceptable, but ``x=[a,b,c]`` is not.

   The ``unsafe`` prefix on this function indicates that using the result of this function after the ``x`` argument to this function is no longer accessible to the program may cause undefined behavior, including program corruption or segfaults, at any later time.

.. function:: cconvert(T,x)

   .. Docstring generated from Julia source

       cconvert(T,x)

   Convert "x" to a value of type "T", typically by calling ``convert(T,x)``

   In cases where "x" cannot be safely converted to "T", unlike ``convert``\ , ``cconvert`` may return an object of a type different from "T", which however is suitable for ``unsafe_convert`` to handle.

   Neither ``convert`` nor ``cconvert`` should take a Julia object and turn it into a ``Ptr``\ .

.. function:: unsafe_load(p::Ptr{T},i::Integer)

   .. Docstring generated from Julia source

       unsafe_load(p::Ptr{T},i::Integer)

   Load a value of type ``T`` from the address of the ith element (1-indexed) starting at ``p``\ . This is equivalent to the C expression ``p[i-1]``\ .

   The ``unsafe`` prefix on this function indicates that no validation is performed on the pointer ``p`` to ensure that it is valid. Incorrect usage may segfault your program or return garbage answers, in the same manner as C.

.. function:: unsafe_store!(p::Ptr{T},x,i::Integer)

   .. Docstring generated from Julia source

       unsafe_store!(p::Ptr{T},x,i::Integer)

   Store a value of type ``T`` to the address of the ith element (1-indexed) starting at ``p``\ . This is equivalent to the C expression ``p[i-1] = x``\ .

   The ``unsafe`` prefix on this function indicates that no validation is performed on the pointer ``p`` to ensure that it is valid. Incorrect usage may corrupt or segfault your program, in the same manner as C.

.. function:: unsafe_copy!(dest::Ptr{T}, src::Ptr{T}, N)

   .. Docstring generated from Julia source

       unsafe_copy!(dest::Ptr{T}, src::Ptr{T}, N)

   Copy ``N`` elements from a source pointer to a destination, with no checking. The size of an element is determined by the type of the pointers.

   The ``unsafe`` prefix on this function indicates that no validation is performed on the pointers ``dest`` and ``src`` to ensure that they are valid. Incorrect usage may corrupt or segfault your program, in the same manner as C.

       unsafe_copy!(dest::Array, do, src::Array, so, N)

   Copy ``N`` elements from a source array to a destination, starting at offset ``so`` in the source and ``do`` in the destination (1-indexed).

   The ``unsafe`` prefix on this function indicates that no validation is performed to ensure that N is inbounds on either array. Incorrect usage may corrupt or segfault your program, in the same manner as C.

.. function:: unsafe_copy!(dest::Array, do, src::Array, so, N)

   .. Docstring generated from Julia source

       unsafe_copy!(dest::Ptr{T}, src::Ptr{T}, N)

   Copy ``N`` elements from a source pointer to a destination, with no checking. The size of an element is determined by the type of the pointers.

   The ``unsafe`` prefix on this function indicates that no validation is performed on the pointers ``dest`` and ``src`` to ensure that they are valid. Incorrect usage may corrupt or segfault your program, in the same manner as C.

       unsafe_copy!(dest::Array, do, src::Array, so, N)

   Copy ``N`` elements from a source array to a destination, starting at offset ``so`` in the source and ``do`` in the destination (1-indexed).

   The ``unsafe`` prefix on this function indicates that no validation is performed to ensure that N is inbounds on either array. Incorrect usage may corrupt or segfault your program, in the same manner as C.

.. function:: copy!(dest, src)

   .. Docstring generated from Julia source

       copy!(dest, src)

   Copy all elements from collection ``src`` to array ``dest``\ . Returns ``dest``\ .

.. function:: copy!(dest, do, src, so, N)

   .. Docstring generated from Julia source

       copy!(dest, do, src, so, N)

   Copy ``N`` elements from collection ``src`` starting at offset ``so``\ , to array ``dest`` starting at offset ``do``\ . Returns ``dest``\ .

.. function:: pointer(array [, index])

   .. Docstring generated from Julia source

       pointer(array [, index])

   Get the native address of an array or string element. Be careful to ensure that a julia reference to ``a`` exists as long as this pointer will be used. This function is "unsafe" like ``unsafe_convert``\ .

   Calling ``Ref(array[, index])`` is generally preferable to this function.

.. function:: pointer_to_array(pointer, dims[, take_ownership::Bool])

   .. Docstring generated from Julia source

       pointer_to_array(pointer, dims[, take_ownership::Bool])

   Wrap a native pointer as a Julia Array object. The pointer element type determines the array element type. ``own`` optionally specifies whether Julia should take ownership of the memory, calling ``free`` on the pointer when the array is no longer referenced.

.. function:: pointer_from_objref(object_instance)

   .. Docstring generated from Julia source

       pointer_from_objref(object_instance)

   Get the memory address of a Julia object as a ``Ptr``\ . The existence of the resulting ``Ptr`` will not protect the object from garbage collection, so you must ensure that the object remains referenced for the whole time that the ``Ptr`` will be used.

.. function:: unsafe_pointer_to_objref(p::Ptr)

   .. Docstring generated from Julia source

       unsafe_pointer_to_objref(p::Ptr)

   Convert a ``Ptr`` to an object reference. Assumes the pointer refers to a valid heap-allocated Julia object. If this is not the case, undefined behavior results, hence this function is considered "unsafe" and should be used with care.

.. function:: disable_sigint(f::Function)

   .. Docstring generated from Julia source

       disable_sigint(f::Function)

   Disable Ctrl-C handler during execution of a function, for calling external code that is not interrupt safe. Intended to be called using ``do`` block syntax as follows:

       disable_sigint() do
           # interrupt-unsafe code
           ...
       end

.. function:: reenable_sigint(f::Function)

   .. Docstring generated from Julia source

       reenable_sigint(f::Function)

   Re-enable Ctrl-C handler during execution of a function. Temporarily reverses the effect of ``disable_sigint``\ .

.. function:: systemerror(sysfunc, iftrue)

   .. Docstring generated from Julia source

       systemerror(sysfunc, iftrue)

   Raises a ``SystemError`` for ``errno`` with the descriptive string ``sysfunc`` if ``bool`` is true

.. data:: Ptr{T}

   A memory address referring to data of type ``T``.
   However, there is no guarantee that the memory is actually valid,
   or that it actually represents data of the specified type.

.. data:: Ref{T}

   An object that safely references data of type ``T``.
   This type is guaranteed to point to valid, Julia-allocated memory
   of the correct type. The underlying data is protected from freeing by
   the garbage collector as long as the ``Ref`` itself is referenced.

   When passed as a ``ccall`` argument (either as a ``Ptr`` or ``Ref`` type),
   a ``Ref`` object will be converted to a native pointer to the data it references.

   There is no invalid (NULL) ``Ref``.
