# Unicode Input

The following table lists Unicode characters that can be entered via
tab completion of LaTeX-like abbreviations in the Julia REPL (and
in various other editing environments).  You can also get information on how to
type a symbol by entering it in the REPL help, i.e. by typing `?` and then
entering the symbol in the REPL (e.g., by copy-paste from somewhere you saw
the symbol).

!!! warning

    This table may appear to contain missing characters in the second column, or even
    show characters that are inconsistent with the characters as they are rendered in
    the Julia REPL. In these cases, users are strongly advised to check their choice
    of fonts in their browser and REPL environment, as there are known issues with
    glyphs in many fonts.
