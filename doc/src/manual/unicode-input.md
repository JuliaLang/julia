# Unicode Input

!!! warning

    This table may appear to contain missing characters in the second column, or even
    show characters that are inconsistent with the characters as they are rendered in
    the Julia REPL. In these cases, users are strongly advised to check their choice
    of fonts in their browser and REPL environment, as there are known issues with
    glyphs in many fonts.
