# Style Guide

The following sections explain a few aspects of idiomatic Julia coding style. None of these rules
are absolute; they are only suggestions to help familiarize you with the language and to help
you choose among alternative designs.

## Write functions, not just scripts

Writing code as a series of steps at the top level is a quick way to get started solving a problem,
but you should try to divide a program into functions as soon as possible. Functions are more
reusable and testable, and clarify what steps are being done and what their inputs and outputs
are. Furthermore, code inside functions tends to run much faster than top level code, due to how
Julia's compiler works.

It is also worth emphasizing that functions should take arguments, instead of operating directly
on global variables (aside from constants like [`pi`](@ref)).

## Avoid writing overly-specific types

Code should be as generic as possible. Instead of writing:

```julia
convert(Complex{Float64}, x)
```

it's better to use available generic functions:

```julia
complex(float(x))
```

The second version will convert `x` to an appropriate type, instead of always the same type.

This style point is especially relevant to function arguments. For example, don't declare an argument
to be of type `Int` or [`Int32`](@ref) if it really could be any integer, expressed with the abstract
type [`Integer`](@ref). In fact, in many cases you can omit the argument type altogether,
unless it is needed to disambiguate from other method definitions, since a
[`MethodError`](@ref) will be thrown anyway if a type is passed that does not support any
of the requisite operations. (This is known as
[duck typing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duck_typing).)

For example, consider the following definitions of a function `addone` that returns one plus its
argument:

```julia
addone(x::Int) = x + 1                 # works only for Int
addone(x::Integer) = x + oneunit(x)    # any integer type
addone(x::Number) = x + oneunit(x)     # any numeric type
addone(x) = x + oneunit(x)             # any type supporting + and oneunit
```

The last definition of `addone` handles any type supporting [`oneunit`](@ref) (which returns 1 in
the same type as `x`, which avoids unwanted type promotion) and the [`+`](@ref) function with
those arguments. The key thing to realize is that there is *no performance penalty* to defining
*only* the general `addone(x) = x + oneunit(x)`, because Julia will automatically compile specialized
versions as needed. For example, the first time you call `addone(12)`, Julia will automatically
compile a specialized `addone` function for `x::Int` arguments, with the call to `oneunit`
replaced by its inlined value `1`. Therefore, the first three definitions of `addone` above are
completely redundant with the fourth definition.

## Handle excess argument diversity in the caller

Instead of:

```julia
function foo(x, y)
    x = Int(x); y = Int(y)
    ...
end
foo(x, y)
```

use:

```julia
function foo(x::Int, y::Int)
    ...
end
foo(Int(x), Int(y))
```

This is better style because `foo` does not really accept numbers of all types; it really needs
`Int` s.

One issue here is that if a function inherently requires integers, it might be better to force
the caller to decide how non-integers should be converted (e.g. floor or ceiling). Another issue
is that declaring more specific types leaves more "space" for future method definitions.

## Append `!` to names of functions that modify their arguments

Instead of:

```julia
function double(a::AbstractArray{<:Number})
    for i = 1:endof(a)
        a[i] *= 2
    end
    return a
end
```

use:

```julia
function double!(a::AbstractArray{<:Number})
    for i = 1:endof(a)
        a[i] *= 2
    end
    return a
end
```

The Julia standard library uses this convention throughout and contains examples of functions
with both copying and modifying forms (e.g., [`sort`](@ref) and [`sort!`](@ref)), and others
which are just modifying (e.g., [`push!`](@ref), [`pop!`](@ref), [`splice!`](@ref)).  It
is typical for such functions to also return the modified array for convenience.

## Avoid strange type `Union`s

Types such as `Union{Function,AbstractString}` are often a sign that some design could be cleaner.

## Avoid type Unions in fields

When creating a type such as:

```julia
mutable struct MyType
    ...
    x::Union{Void,T}
end
```

ask whether the option for `x` to be `nothing` (of type `Void`) is really necessary. Here are
some alternatives to consider:

  * Find a safe default value to initialize `x` with
  * Introduce another type that lacks `x`
  * If there are many fields like `x`, store them in a dictionary
  * Determine whether there is a simple rule for when `x` is `nothing`. For example, often the field
    will start as `nothing` but get initialized at some well-defined point. In that case, consider
    leaving it undefined at first.
  * If `x` really needs to hold no value at some times, define it as `::Nullable{T}` instead, as this
    guarantees type-stability in the code accessing this field (see [Nullable types](@ref man-nullable-types)).

## Avoid elaborate container types

It is usually not much help to construct arrays like the following:

```julia
a = Vector{Union{Int,AbstractString,Tuple,Array}}(uninitialized, n)
```

In this case `Vector{Any}(uninitialized, n)` is better. It is also more helpful to the compiler to annotate specific
uses (e.g. `a[i]::Int`) than to try to pack many alternatives into one type.

## Use naming conventions consistent with Julia's `base/`

  * modules and type names use capitalization and camel case: `module SparseArrays`, `struct UnitRange`.
  * functions are lowercase ([`maximum`](@ref), [`convert`](@ref)) and, when readable, with multiple
    words squashed together ([`isequal`](@ref), [`haskey`](@ref)). When necessary, use underscores
    as word separators. Underscores are also used to indicate a combination of concepts ([`remotecall_fetch`](@ref)
    as a more efficient implementation of `fetch(remotecall(...))`) or as modifiers.
  * conciseness is valued, but avoid abbreviation ([`indexin`](@ref) rather than `indxin`) as
    it becomes difficult to remember whether and how particular words are abbreviated.

If a function name requires multiple words, consider whether it might represent more than one
concept and might be better split into pieces.

## Don't overuse try-catch

It is better to avoid errors than to rely on catching them.

## Don't parenthesize conditions

Julia doesn't require parens around conditions in `if` and `while`. Write:

```julia
if a == b
```

instead of:

```julia
if (a == b)
```

## Don't overuse `...`

Splicing function arguments can be addictive. Instead of `[a..., b...]`, use simply `[a; b]`,
which already concatenates arrays. [`collect(a)`](@ref) is better than `[a...]`, but since `a`
is already iterable it is often even better to leave it alone, and not convert it to an array.

## Don't use unnecessary static parameters

A function signature:

```julia
foo(x::T) where {T<:Real} = ...
```

should be written as:

```julia
foo(x::Real) = ...
```

instead, especially if `T` is not used in the function body. Even if `T` is used, it can be replaced
with [`typeof(x)`](@ref) if convenient. There is no performance difference. Note that this is
not a general caution against static parameters, just against uses where they are not needed.

Note also that container types, specifically may need type parameters in function calls. See the
FAQ [Avoid fields with abstract containers](@ref) for more information.

## Avoid confusion about whether something is an instance or a type

Sets of definitions like the following are confusing:

```julia
foo(::Type{MyType}) = ...
foo(::MyType) = foo(MyType)
```

Decide whether the concept in question will be written as `MyType` or `MyType()`, and stick to
it.

The preferred style is to use instances by default, and only add methods involving `Type{MyType}`
later if they become necessary to solve some problem.

If a type is effectively an enumeration, it should be defined as a single (ideally immutable struct or primitive)
type, with the enumeration values being instances of it. Constructors and conversions can check
whether values are valid. This design is preferred over making the enumeration an abstract type,
with the "values" as subtypes.

## Don't overuse macros

Be aware of when a macro could really be a function instead.

Calling [`eval`](@ref) inside a macro is a particularly dangerous warning sign; it means the
macro will only work when called at the top level. If such a macro is written as a function instead,
it will naturally have access to the run-time values it needs.

## Don't expose unsafe operations at the interface level

If you have a type that uses a native pointer:

```julia
mutable struct NativeType
    p::Ptr{UInt8}
    ...
end
```

don't write definitions like the following:

```julia
getindex(x::NativeType, i) = unsafe_load(x.p, i)
```

The problem is that users of this type can write `x[i]` without realizing that the operation is
unsafe, and then be susceptible to memory bugs.

Such a function should either check the operation to ensure it is safe, or have `unsafe` somewhere
in its name to alert callers.

## Don't overload methods of base container types

It is possible to write definitions like the following:

```julia
show(io::IO, v::Vector{MyType}) = ...
```

This would provide custom showing of vectors with a specific new element type. While tempting,
this should be avoided. The trouble is that users will expect a well-known type like `Vector()`
to behave in a certain way, and overly customizing its behavior can make it harder to work with.

## Avoid type piracy

"Type piracy" refers to the practice of extending or redefining methods in Base
or other packages on types that you have not defined. In some cases, you can get away with
type piracy with little ill effect. In extreme cases, however, you can even crash Julia
(e.g. if your method extension or redefinition causes invalid input to be passed to a
`ccall`). Type piracy can complicate reasoning about code, and may introduce
incompatibilities that are hard to predict and diagnose.

As an example, suppose you wanted to define multiplication on symbols in a module:

```julia
module A
import Base.*
*(x::Symbol, y::Symbol) = Symbol(x,y)
end
```

The problem is that now any other module that uses `Base.*` will also see this definition.
Since `Symbol` is defined in Base and is used by other modules, this can change the
behavior of unrelated code unexpectedly. There are several alternatives here, including
using a different function name, or wrapping the `Symbol`s in another type that you define.

Sometimes, coupled packages may engage in type piracy to separate features from definitions,
especially when the packages were designed by collaborating authors, and when the
definitions are reusable. For example, one package might provide some types useful for
working with colors; another package could define methods for those types that enable
conversions between color spaces. Another example might be a package that acts as a thin
wrapper for some C code, which another package might then pirate to implement a
higher-level, Julia-friendly API.

## Be careful with type equality

You generally want to use [`isa`](@ref) and [`<:`](@ref) for testing types,
not `==`. Checking types for exact equality typically only makes sense when comparing to a known
concrete type (e.g. `T == Float64`), or if you *really, really* know what you're doing.

## Do not write `x->f(x)`

Since higher-order functions are often called with anonymous functions, it is easy to conclude
that this is desirable or even necessary. But any function can be passed directly, without being
"wrapped" in an anonymous function. Instead of writing `map(x->f(x), a)`, write [`map(f, a)`](@ref).

## Avoid using floats for numeric literals in generic code when possible

If you write generic code which handles numbers, and which can be expected to run with many different
numeric type arguments, try using literals of a numeric type that will affect the arguments as
little as possible through promotion.

For example,

```jldoctest
julia> f(x) = 2.0 * x
f (generic function with 1 method)

julia> f(1//2)
1.0

julia> f(1/2)
1.0

julia> f(1)
2.0
```

while

```jldoctest
julia> g(x) = 2 * x
g (generic function with 1 method)

julia> g(1//2)
1//1

julia> g(1/2)
1.0

julia> g(1)
2
```

As you can see, the second version, where we used an `Int` literal, preserved the type of the
input argument, while the first didn't. This is because e.g. `promote_type(Int, Float64) == Float64`,
and promotion happens with the multiplication. Similarly, [`Rational`](@ref) literals are less type disruptive
than [`Float64`](@ref) literals, but more disruptive than `Int`s:

```jldoctest
julia> h(x) = 2//1 * x
h (generic function with 1 method)

julia> h(1//2)
1//1

julia> h(1/2)
1.0

julia> h(1)
2//1
```

Thus, use `Int` literals when possible, with `Rational{Int}` for literal non-integer numbers,
in order to make it easier to use your code.
