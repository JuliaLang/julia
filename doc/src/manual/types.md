*********
 Types
*********

Type systems have traditionally fallen into two quite different camps:
static type systems, where every program expression must have a type
computable before the execution of the program, and dynamic type
systems, where nothing is known about types until run time, when the
actual values manipulated by the program are available. Object
orientation allows some flexibility in statically typed languages by
letting code be written without the precise types of values being known
at compile time. The ability to write code that can operate on different
types is called polymorphism. All code in classic dynamically typed
languages is polymorphic: only by explicitly checking types, or when
objects fail to support operations at run-time, are the types of any
values ever restricted.

Julia's type system is dynamic, but gains some of the advantages of
static type systems by making it possible to indicate that certain
values are of specific types. This can be of great assistance in
generating efficient code, but even more significantly, it allows method
dispatch on the types of function arguments to be deeply integrated with
the language. Method dispatch is explored in detail in
:ref:`man-methods`, but is rooted in the type system presented
here.

The default behavior in Julia when types are omitted is to allow values
to be of any type. Thus, one can write many useful Julia programs
without ever explicitly using types. When additional expressiveness is
needed, however, it is easy to gradually introduce explicit type
annotations into previously "untyped" code. Doing so will typically
increase both the performance and robustness of these systems, and
perhaps somewhat counterintuitively, often significantly simplify them.

Describing Julia in the lingo of `type
systems <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_system>`_, it is: dynamic,
nominative and parametric. Generic types can be parameterized,
and the hierarchical relationships between types are `explicitly
declared <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nominal_type_system>`_,
rather than `implied by compatible structure
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structural_type_system>`_.
One particularly distinctive feature of Julia's type system
is that concrete types may not subtype each other: all concrete types
are final and may only have abstract types as their supertypes. While
this might at first seem unduly restrictive, it has many beneficial
consequences with surprisingly few drawbacks. It turns out that being
able to inherit behavior is much more important than being able to
inherit structure, and inheriting both causes significant difficulties
in traditional object-oriented languages. Other high-level aspects of
Julia's type system that should be mentioned up front are:

-  There is no division between object and non-object values: all values
   in Julia are true objects having a type that belongs to a single,
   fully connected type graph, all nodes of which are equally
   first-class as types.
-  There is no meaningful concept of a "compile-time type": the only
   type a value has is its actual type when the program is running. This
   is called a "run-time type" in object-oriented languages where the
   combination of static compilation with polymorphism makes this
   distinction significant.
-  Only values, not variables, have types — variables are simply names
   bound to values.
-  Both abstract and concrete types can be parameterized by other types.
   They can also be parameterized by symbols, by values of any type for
   which :func:`isbits` returns true (essentially, things like numbers and bools
   that are stored like C types or structs with no pointers to other objects),
   and also by tuples thereof. Type parameters may be omitted when they
   do not need to be referenced or restricted.

Julia's type system is designed to be powerful and expressive, yet
clear, intuitive and unobtrusive. Many Julia programmers may never feel
the need to write code that explicitly uses types. Some kinds of
programming, however, become clearer, simpler, faster and more robust
with declared types.

Type Declarations
-----------------

The ``::`` operator can be used to attach type annotations to
expressions and variables in programs. There are two primary reasons to
do this:

1. As an assertion to help confirm that your program works the way you
   expect,
2. To provide extra type information to the compiler, which can then
   improve performance in some cases

When appended to an expression computing a value, the ``::``
operator is read as "is an instance of". It can be used
anywhere to assert that the value of the expression on the left is an
instance of the type on the right. When the type on the right is
concrete, the value on the left must have that type as its
implementation — recall that all concrete types are final, so no
implementation is a subtype of any other. When the type is abstract, it
suffices for the value to be implemented by a concrete type that is a
subtype of the abstract type. If the type assertion is not true, an
exception is thrown, otherwise, the left-hand value is returned:

.. doctest::

    julia> (1+2)::AbstractFloat
    ERROR: TypeError: typeassert: expected AbstractFloat, got Int64
     ...

    julia> (1+2)::Int
    3

This allows a type assertion to be attached to any expression
in-place.

When appended to a variable on the left-hand side of an assignment,
or as part of a ``local`` declaration, the ``::`` operator means something
a bit different: it declares the variable to always have the specified type,
like a type declaration in a statically-typed language such as C. Every
value assigned to the variable will be converted to the declared type
using :func:`convert`:

.. doctest:: foo-func

    julia> function foo()
               x::Int8 = 100
               x
           end
    foo (generic function with 1 method)

    julia> foo()
    100

    julia> typeof(ans)
    Int8

This feature is useful for avoiding performance "gotchas" that could
occur if one of the assignments to a variable changed its type
unexpectedly.

This "declaration" behavior only occurs in specific contexts::

    local x::Int8  # in a local declaration
    x::Int8 = 10   # as the left-hand side of an assignment

and applies to the whole current scope, even before the declaration.
Currently, type declarations cannot be used in global scope, e.g. in
the REPL, since Julia does not yet have constant-type globals.

Declarations can also be attached to function definitions::

    function sinc(x)::Float64
        if x == 0
            return 1
        end
        return sin(pi*x)/(pi*x)
    end

Returning from this function behaves just like an assignment to
a variable with a declared type: the value is always converted to
``Float64``.


.. _man-abstract-types:

Abstract Types
--------------

Abstract types cannot be instantiated, and serve only as nodes in the
type graph, thereby describing sets of related concrete types: those
concrete types which are their descendants. We begin with abstract types
even though they have no instantiation because they are the backbone of
the type system: they form the conceptual hierarchy which makes Julia's
type system more than just a collection of object implementations.

Recall that in :ref:`man-integers-and-floating-point-numbers`, we
introduced a variety of concrete types of numeric values: :class:`Int8`,
:class:`UInt8`, :class:`Int16`, :class:`UInt16`, :class:`Int32`, :class:`UInt32`, :class:`Int64`,
:class:`UInt64`, :class:`Int128`, :class:`UInt128`, :class:`Float16`, :class:`Float32`, and
:class:`Float64`.  Although they have different representation sizes, :class:`Int8`,
:class:`Int16`, :class:`Int32`, :class:`Int64`  and :class:`Int128` all have in common that
they are signed integer types. Likewise :class:`UInt8`, :class:`UInt16`, :class:`UInt32`,
:class:`UInt64` and :class:`UInt128` are all unsigned integer types, while
:class:`Float16`, :class:`Float32` and :class:`Float64` are distinct in being
floating-point types rather than integers. It is common for a piece of code
to make sense, for example, only if its arguments are some kind of integer,
but not really depend on what particular *kind* of integer.  For example,
the greatest common denominator algorithm works for all kinds of integers,
but will not work for floating-point numbers.  Abstract types allow the
construction of a hierarchy of types, providing a context into which
concrete types can fit.  This allows you, for example, to easily program to
any type that is an integer, without restricting an algorithm to a specific
type of integer.

Abstract types are declared using the ``abstract`` keyword. The general
syntaxes for declaring an abstract type are::

    abstract «name»
    abstract «name» <: «supertype»

The ``abstract`` keyword introduces a new abstract type, whose name is
given by ``«name»``. This name can be optionally followed by ``<:`` and
an already-existing type, indicating that the newly declared abstract
type is a subtype of this "parent" type.

When no supertype is given, the default supertype is :obj:`Any` — a
predefined abstract type that all objects are instances of and all types
are subtypes of. In type theory, :obj:`Any` is commonly called "top"
because it is at the apex of the type graph. Julia also has a predefined
abstract "bottom" type, at the nadir of the type graph, which is written as
``Union{}``. It is the exact opposite of :obj:`Any`: no object is an instance
of ``Union{}`` and all types are supertypes of ``Union{}``.

Let's consider some of the abstract types that make up Julia's numerical
hierarchy::

    abstract Number
    abstract Real     <: Number
    abstract AbstractFloat <: Real
    abstract Integer  <: Real
    abstract Signed   <: Integer
    abstract Unsigned <: Integer

The :obj:`Number` type is a direct child type of :obj:`Any`, and :obj:`Real` is
its child. In turn, :obj:`Real` has two children (it has more, but only two
are shown here; we'll get to the others later): :class:`Integer` and
:class:`AbstractFloat`, separating the world into representations of integers and
representations of real numbers. Representations of real numbers
include, of course, floating-point types, but also include other types,
such as rationals. Hence, :class:`AbstractFloat` is a proper subtype of
:obj:`Real`, including only floating-point representations of real numbers.
Integers are further subdivided into :obj:`Signed` and :obj:`Unsigned`
varieties.

The ``<:`` operator in general means "is a subtype of", and, used in
declarations like this, declares the right-hand type to be an immediate
supertype of the newly declared type. It can also be used in expressions
as a subtype operator which returns ``true`` when its left operand is a
subtype of its right operand:

.. doctest::

    julia> Integer <: Number
    true

    julia> Integer <: AbstractFloat
    false

An important use of abstract types is to provide default implementations for
concrete types. To give a simple example, consider::

    function myplus(x,y)
        x+y
    end

The first thing to note is that the above argument declarations are equivalent
to ``x::Any`` and ``y::Any``. When this function is invoked, say as
``myplus(2,5)``, the dispatcher chooses the most specific method named
``myplus`` that matches the given arguments. (See :ref:`man-methods` for more
information on multiple dispatch.)

Assuming no method more specific than the above is found, Julia next internally
defines and compiles a method called ``myplus`` specifically for two :class:`Int`
arguments based on the generic function given above, i.e., it implicitly
defines and compiles::

    function myplus(x::Int,y::Int)
        x+y
    end

and finally, it invokes this specific method.

Thus, abstract types allow programmers to write generic functions that can
later be used as the default method by many combinations of concrete types.
Thanks to multiple dispatch, the programmer has full control over whether the
default or more specific method is used.

An important point to note is that there is no loss in performance if the
programmer relies on a function whose arguments are abstract types, because it
is recompiled for each tuple of argument concrete types with which it is
invoked. (There may be a performance issue, however, in the case of function
arguments that are containers of abstract types; see :ref:`man-performance-tips`.)


Bits Types
----------

A bits type is a concrete type whose data consists of plain old bits.
Classic examples of bits types are integers and floating-point values.
Unlike most languages, Julia lets you declare your own bits types,
rather than providing only a fixed set of built-in bits types. In fact,
the standard bits types are all defined in the language itself::

    bitstype 16 Float16 <: AbstractFloat
    bitstype 32 Float32 <: AbstractFloat
    bitstype 64 Float64 <: AbstractFloat

    bitstype 8  Bool <: Integer
    bitstype 32 Char

    bitstype 8  Int8     <: Signed
    bitstype 8  UInt8    <: Unsigned
    bitstype 16 Int16    <: Signed
    bitstype 16 UInt16   <: Unsigned
    bitstype 32 Int32    <: Signed
    bitstype 32 UInt32   <: Unsigned
    bitstype 64 Int64    <: Signed
    bitstype 64 UInt64   <: Unsigned
    bitstype 128 Int128  <: Signed
    bitstype 128 UInt128 <: Unsigned

The general syntaxes for declaration of a ``bitstype`` are::

    bitstype «bits» «name»
    bitstype «bits» «name» <: «supertype»

The number of bits indicates how much storage the type requires and the
name gives the new type a name. A bits type can optionally be declared
to be a subtype of some supertype. If a supertype is omitted, then the
type defaults to having :obj:`Any` as its immediate supertype. The
declaration of :obj:`Bool` above therefore means that a boolean value takes
eight bits to store, and has :class:`Integer` as its immediate supertype.
Currently, only sizes that are multiples of 8 bits are supported.
Therefore, boolean values, although they really need just a single bit,
cannot be declared to be any smaller than eight bits.

The types :obj:`Bool`, :class:`Int8` and :class:`UInt8` all have identical
representations: they are eight-bit chunks of memory. Since Julia's type
system is nominative, however, they are not interchangeable despite
having identical structure. A fundamental difference between them
is that they have different supertypes: :obj:`Bool`'s direct supertype is
:class:`Integer`, :class:`Int8`'s is :obj:`Signed`, and :class:`UInt8`'s is :obj:`Unsigned`.
All other differences between :obj:`Bool`, :class:`Int8`, and :class:`UInt8` are
matters of behavior — the way functions are defined to act when given
objects of these types as arguments. This is why a nominative type
system is necessary: if structure determined type, which in turn
dictates behavior, then it would be impossible to make :obj:`Bool` behave any
differently than :class:`Int8` or :class:`UInt8`.

.. _man-composite-types:

Composite Types
---------------

`Composite types <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Composite_data_type>`_
are called records, structures (``struct``\ s in C), or objects in various
languages. A composite type is a collection of named fields, an instance
of which can be treated as a single value. In many languages, composite
types are the only kind of user-definable type, and they are by far the
most commonly used user-defined type in Julia as well.

In mainstream
object oriented languages, such as C++, Java, Python and Ruby, composite
types also have named functions associated with them, and the
combination is called an "object". In purer object-oriented languages,
such as Ruby or Smalltalk, all values are objects whether they are
composites or not. In less pure object oriented languages, including C++
and Java, some values, such as integers and floating-point values, are
not objects, while instances of user-defined composite types are true
objects with associated methods. In Julia, all values are objects,
but functions are not bundled with the objects they
operate on. This is necessary since Julia chooses which method of a
function to use by multiple dispatch, meaning that the types of *all* of
a function's arguments are considered when selecting a method, rather
than just the first one (see :ref:`man-methods` for more
information on methods and dispatch). Thus, it would be inappropriate
for functions to "belong" to only their first argument. Organizing
methods into function objects rather than having
named bags of methods "inside" each object ends up being a highly
beneficial aspect of the language design.

Since composite types are the most common form of user-defined concrete
type, they are simply introduced with the ``type`` keyword followed by a
block of field names, optionally annotated with types using the ``::``
operator:

.. doctest::

    julia> type Foo
               bar
               baz::Int
               qux::Float64
           end

Fields with no type annotation default to :obj:`Any`, and can accordingly
hold any type of value.

New objects of composite type ``Foo`` are created by applying the
``Foo`` type object like a function to values for its fields:

.. doctest::

    julia> foo = Foo("Hello, world.", 23, 1.5)
    Foo("Hello, world.",23,1.5)

    julia> typeof(foo)
    Foo

When a type is applied like a function it is called a *constructor*.
Two constructors are generated automatically (these are called *default
constructors*). One accepts any arguments and calls :func:`convert` to convert
them to the types of the fields, and the other accepts arguments that
match the field types exactly. The reason both of these are generated is
that this makes it easier to add new definitions without inadvertently
replacing a default constructor.

Since the ``bar`` field is unconstrained in type, any value will do.
However, the value for ``baz`` must be convertible to :class:`Int`:

.. doctest::

    julia> Foo((), 23.5, 1)
    ERROR: InexactError()
     in convert(::Type{Int64}, ::Float64) at ./float.jl:656
     in Foo(::Tuple{}, ::Float64, ::Int64) at ./none:2
     ...

You may find a list of field names using the ``fieldnames`` function.

.. doctest::

    julia> fieldnames(foo)
    3-element Array{Symbol,1}:
     :bar
     :baz
     :qux

You can access the field values of a composite object using the
traditional ``foo.bar`` notation:

.. doctest::

    julia> foo.bar
    "Hello, world."

    julia> foo.baz
    23

    julia> foo.qux
    1.5

You can also change the values as one would expect:

.. doctest::

    julia> foo.qux = 2
    2

    julia> foo.bar = 1//2
    1//2

Composite types with no fields are singletons; there can be only one
instance of such types::

    type NoFields
    end

    julia> NoFields() === NoFields()
    true

The ``===`` function confirms that the "two" constructed instances of
``NoFields`` are actually one and the same. Singleton types are
described in further detail `below <#man-singleton-types>`_.

There is much more to say about how instances of composite types are
created, but that discussion depends on both `Parametric
Types <#man-parametric-types>`_ and on :ref:`man-methods`, and is
sufficiently important to be addressed in its own section:
:ref:`man-constructors`.

.. _man-immutable-composite-types:

Immutable Composite Types
-------------------------

It is also possible to define *immutable* composite types by using
the keyword ``immutable`` instead of ``type``::

    immutable Complex
        real::Float64
        imag::Float64
    end

Such types behave much like other composite types, except that instances
of them cannot be modified. Immutable types have several advantages:

- They are more efficient in some cases. Types like the ``Complex``
  example above can be packed efficiently into arrays, and in some
  cases the compiler is able to avoid allocating immutable objects
  entirely.
- It is not possible to violate the invariants provided by the
  type's constructors.
- Code using immutable objects can be easier to reason about.

An immutable object might contain mutable objects, such as arrays, as
fields. Those contained objects will remain mutable; only the fields of the
immutable object itself cannot be changed to point to different objects.

A useful way to think about immutable composites is that each instance is
associated with specific field values --- the field values alone tell
you everything about the object. In contrast, a mutable object is like a
little container that might hold different values over time, and so is
not identified with specific field values. In deciding whether to make a
type immutable, ask whether two instances with the same field values
would be considered identical, or if they might need to change independently
over time. If they would be considered identical, the type should probably
be immutable.

To recap, two essential properties define immutability
in Julia:

* An object with an immutable type is passed around (both in assignment
  statements and in function calls) by copying, whereas a mutable type is
  passed around by reference.

* It is not permitted to modify the fields of a composite immutable
  type.

It is instructive, particularly for readers whose background is C/C++, to consider
why these two properties go hand in hand.  If they were separated,
i.e., if the fields of objects passed around by copying could be modified,
then it would become more difficult to reason about certain instances of generic code.  For example,
suppose ``x`` is a function argument of an abstract type, and suppose that the function
changes a field: ``x.isprocessed = true``.  Depending on whether ``x`` is passed by copying
or by reference, this statement may or may not alter the actual argument in the
calling routine.  Julia
sidesteps the possibility of creating functions with unknown effects in this
scenario by forbidding modification of fields
of objects passed around by copying.


Declared Types
--------------

The three kinds of types discussed in the previous three sections
are actually all closely related. They share the same key properties:

- They are explicitly declared.
- They have names.
- They have explicitly declared supertypes.
- They may have parameters.

Because of these shared properties, these types are internally
represented as instances of the same concept, :obj:`DataType`, which
is the type of any of these types:

.. doctest::

    julia> typeof(Real)
    DataType

    julia> typeof(Int)
    DataType

A :obj:`DataType` may be abstract or concrete. If it is concrete, it
has a specified size, storage layout, and (optionally) field names.
Thus a bits type is a :obj:`DataType` with nonzero size, but no field
names. A composite type is a :obj:`DataType` that has field names or
is empty (zero size).

Every concrete value in the system is an instance of some :obj:`DataType`.

Type Unions
-----------

A type union is a special abstract type which includes as objects all
instances of any of its argument types, constructed using the special
``Union`` function::

    julia> IntOrString = Union{Int,AbstractString}
    Union{AbstractString,Int64}

    julia> 1 :: IntOrString
    1

    julia> "Hello!" :: IntOrString
    "Hello!"

    julia> 1.0 :: IntOrString
    ERROR: type: typeassert: expected Union{AbstractString,Int64}, got Float64

The compilers for many languages have an internal union construct for
reasoning about types; Julia simply exposes it to the programmer.

.. _man-parametric-types:

Parametric Types
----------------

An important and powerful feature of Julia's type system is that it is
parametric: types can take parameters, so that type declarations
actually introduce a whole family of new types — one for each possible
combination of parameter values. There are many languages that support
some version of `generic
programming <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generic_programming>`_, wherein
data structures and algorithms to manipulate them may be specified
without specifying the exact types involved. For example, some form of
generic programming exists in ML, Haskell, Ada, Eiffel, C++, Java, C#,
F#, and Scala, just to name a few. Some of these languages support true
parametric polymorphism (e.g. ML, Haskell, Scala), while others support
ad-hoc, template-based styles of generic programming (e.g. C++, Java).
With so many different varieties of generic programming and parametric
types in various languages, we won't even attempt to compare Julia's
parametric types to other languages, but will instead focus on
explaining Julia's system in its own right. We will note, however, that
because Julia is a dynamically typed language and doesn't need to make
all type decisions at compile time, many traditional difficulties
encountered in static parametric type systems can be relatively easily
handled.

All declared types (the :obj:`DataType` variety) can be parameterized, with
the same syntax in each case. We will discuss them in the following
order: first, parametric composite types, then parametric abstract
types, and finally parametric bits types.

Parametric Composite Types
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. testsetup::

    abstract Pointy{T}
    type Point{T} <: Pointy{T}
        x::T
        y::T
    end

Type parameters are introduced immediately after the type name,
surrounded by curly braces::

    type Point{T}
        x::T
        y::T
    end

This declaration defines a new parametric type, ``Point{T}``, holding
two "coordinates" of type ``T``. What, one may ask, is ``T``? Well,
that's precisely the point of parametric types: it can be any type at
all (or a value of any bits type, actually, although here it's clearly
used as a type). ``Point{Float64}`` is a concrete type equivalent to the
type defined by replacing ``T`` in the definition of ``Point`` with
:class:`Float64`. Thus, this single declaration actually declares an
unlimited number of types: ``Point{Float64}``, ``Point{AbstractString}``,
``Point{Int64}``, etc. Each of these is now a usable concrete type:

.. doctest::

    julia> Point{Float64}
    Point{Float64}

    julia> Point{AbstractString}
    Point{AbstractString}

The type ``Point{Float64}`` is a point whose coordinates are 64-bit
floating-point values, while the type ``Point{AbstractString}`` is a "point"
whose "coordinates" are string objects (see :ref:`man-strings`).
However, ``Point`` itself is also a valid type object:

.. doctest::

    julia> Point
    Point{T}

Here the ``T`` is the dummy type symbol used in the original declaration
of ``Point``. What does ``Point`` by itself mean? It is a type
that contains all the specific instances ``Point{Float64}``,
``Point{AbstractString}``, etc.:

.. doctest::

    julia> Point{Float64} <: Point
    true

    julia> Point{AbstractString} <: Point
    true

Other types, of course, are not subtypes of it:

.. doctest::

    julia> Float64 <: Point
    false

    julia> AbstractString <: Point
    false

Concrete ``Point`` types with different values of ``T`` are never
subtypes of each other:

.. doctest::

    julia> Point{Float64} <: Point{Int64}
    false

    julia> Point{Float64} <: Point{Real}
    false

This last point is very important:

- **Even though** ``Float64 <: Real`` **we DO NOT have**
  ``Point{Float64} <: Point{Real}``\ **.**

In other words, in the parlance of type theory, Julia's type parameters
are *invariant*, rather than being covariant (or even contravariant).
This is for practical reasons: while any instance of ``Point{Float64}``
may conceptually be like an instance of ``Point{Real}`` as well, the two
types have different representations in memory:

-  An instance of ``Point{Float64}`` can be represented compactly and
   efficiently as an immediate pair of 64-bit values;
-  An instance of ``Point{Real}`` must be able to hold any pair of
   instances of :obj:`Real`. Since objects that are instances of :obj:`Real`
   can be of arbitrary size and structure, in practice an instance of
   ``Point{Real}`` must be represented as a pair of pointers to
   individually allocated :obj:`Real` objects.

The efficiency gained by being able to store ``Point{Float64}`` objects
with immediate values is magnified enormously in the case of arrays: an
``Array{Float64}`` can be stored as a contiguous memory block of 64-bit
floating-point values, whereas an ``Array{Real}`` must be an array of
pointers to individually allocated :obj:`Real` objects — which may well be
`boxed <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object_type_%28object-oriented_programming%29#Boxing>`_
64-bit floating-point values, but also might be arbitrarily large,
complex objects, which are declared to be implementations of the
:obj:`Real` abstract type.

Since ``Point{Float64}`` is not a subtype of ``Point{Real}``, the following method can't be applied to arguments of type ``Point{Float64}``::

    function norm(p::Point{Real})
       sqrt(p.x^2 + p.y^2)
    end

The correct way to define a method that accepts all arguments of type ``Point{T}`` where ``T`` is a subtype of ``Real`` is::

    function norm{T<:Real}(p::Point{T})
       sqrt(p.x^2 + p.y^2)
    end

More examples will be discussed later in :ref:`man-methods`.


How does one construct a ``Point`` object? It is possible to define
custom constructors for composite types, which will be discussed in
detail in :ref:`man-constructors`, but in the absence of any
special constructor declarations, there are two default ways of creating
new composite objects, one in which the type parameters are explicitly
given and the other in which they are implied by the arguments to the
object constructor.

Since the type ``Point{Float64}`` is a concrete type equivalent to
``Point`` declared with :class:`Float64` in place of ``T``, it can be applied
as a constructor accordingly:

.. doctest::

    julia> Point{Float64}(1.0,2.0)
    Point{Float64}(1.0,2.0)

    julia> typeof(ans)
    Point{Float64}

For the default constructor, exactly one argument must be supplied for
each field:

.. doctest::

    julia> Point{Float64}(1.0)
    ERROR: MethodError: Cannot `convert` an object of type Float64 to an object of type Point{Float64}
    This may have arisen from a call to the constructor Point{Float64}(...),
    since type constructors fall back to convert methods.
     in Point{Float64}(::Float64) at ./sysimg.jl:66
     ...

    julia> Point{Float64}(1.0,2.0,3.0)
    ERROR: MethodError: no method matching Point{Float64}(::Float64, ::Float64, ::Float64)
    Closest candidates are:
      Point{Float64}{T}(::Any, ::Any) at none:3
      Point{Float64}{T}(::Any) at sysimg.jl:66
     ...

Only one default constructor is generated for parametric types, since
overriding it is not possible. This constructor accepts any arguments
and converts them to the field types.

In many cases, it is redundant to provide the type of ``Point`` object
one wants to construct, since the types of arguments to the constructor
call already implicitly provide type information. For that reason, you
can also apply ``Point`` itself as a constructor, provided that the
implied value of the parameter type ``T`` is unambiguous:

.. doctest::

    julia> Point(1.0,2.0)
    Point{Float64}(1.0,2.0)

    julia> typeof(ans)
    Point{Float64}

    julia> Point(1,2)
    Point{Int64}(1,2)

    julia> typeof(ans)
    Point{Int64}

In the case of ``Point``, the type of ``T`` is unambiguously implied if
and only if the two arguments to ``Point`` have the same type. When this
isn't the case, the constructor will fail with a :exc:`MethodError`:

.. doctest::

    julia> Point(1,2.5)
    ERROR: MethodError: no method matching Point{T}(::Int64, ::Float64)
    ...

Constructor methods to appropriately handle such mixed cases can be
defined, but that will not be discussed until later on in
:ref:`man-constructors`.

Parametric Abstract Types
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Parametric abstract type declarations declare a collection of abstract
types, in much the same way::

    abstract Pointy{T}

With this declaration, ``Pointy{T}`` is a distinct abstract type for
each type or integer value of ``T``. As with parametric composite types,
each such instance is a subtype of ``Pointy``:

.. doctest::

    julia> Pointy{Int64} <: Pointy
    true

    julia> Pointy{1} <: Pointy
    true

Parametric abstract types are invariant, much as parametric composite
types are:

.. doctest::

    julia> Pointy{Float64} <: Pointy{Real}
    false

    julia> Pointy{Real} <: Pointy{Float64}
    false

Much as plain old abstract types serve to create a useful hierarchy of
types over concrete types, parametric abstract types serve the same
purpose with respect to parametric composite types. We could, for
example, have declared ``Point{T}`` to be a subtype of ``Pointy{T}`` as
follows::

    type Point{T} <: Pointy{T}
        x::T
        y::T
    end

Given such a declaration, for each choice of ``T``, we have ``Point{T}``
as a subtype of ``Pointy{T}``:

.. doctest::

    julia> Point{Float64} <: Pointy{Float64}
    true

    julia> Point{Real} <: Pointy{Real}
    true

    julia> Point{AbstractString} <: Pointy{AbstractString}
    true

This relationship is also invariant:

.. doctest::

    julia> Point{Float64} <: Pointy{Real}
    false

What purpose do parametric abstract types like ``Pointy`` serve?
Consider if we create a point-like implementation that only requires a
single coordinate because the point is on the diagonal line *x = y*::

    type DiagPoint{T} <: Pointy{T}
        x::T
    end

Now both ``Point{Float64}`` and ``DiagPoint{Float64}`` are
implementations of the ``Pointy{Float64}`` abstraction, and similarly
for every other possible choice of type ``T``. This allows programming
to a common interface shared by all ``Pointy`` objects, implemented for
both ``Point`` and ``DiagPoint``. This cannot be fully demonstrated,
however, until we have introduced methods and dispatch in the next
section, :ref:`man-methods`.

There are situations where it may not make sense for type parameters to
range freely over all possible types. In such situations, one can
constrain the range of ``T`` like so::

    abstract Pointy{T<:Real}

With such a declaration, it is acceptable to use any type that is a
subtype of :obj:`Real` in place of ``T``, but not types that are not
subtypes of :obj:`Real`:

.. testsetup:: real-pointy

    abstract Pointy{T<:Real}

.. doctest:: real-pointy

    julia> Pointy{Float64}
    Pointy{Float64}

    julia> Pointy{Real}
    Pointy{Real}

    julia> Pointy{AbstractString}
    ERROR: TypeError: Pointy: in T, expected T<:Real, got Type{AbstractString}
     ...

    julia> Pointy{1}
    ERROR: TypeError: Pointy: in T, expected T<:Real, got Int64
     ...

Type parameters for parametric composite types can be restricted in the
same manner::

    type Point{T<:Real} <: Pointy{T}
        x::T
        y::T
    end

To give a real-world example of how all this parametric type
machinery can be useful, here is the actual definition of Julia's
:obj:`Rational` immutable type (except that we omit the constructor here
for simplicity), representing an exact ratio of integers::

    immutable Rational{T<:Integer} <: Real
        num::T
        den::T
    end

It only makes sense to take ratios of integer values, so the parameter
type ``T`` is restricted to being a subtype of :class:`Integer`, and a ratio
of integers represents a value on the real number line, so any
:obj:`Rational` is an instance of the :obj:`Real` abstraction.

Tuple Types
~~~~~~~~~~~

Tuples are an abstraction of the arguments of a function — without the
function itself. The salient aspects of a function's arguments are their
order and their types. Therefore a tuple type is similar to a
parameterized immutable type where each parameter is the type
of one field. For example, a 2-element tuple type resembles the following
immutable type::

    immutable Tuple2{A,B}
        a::A
        b::B
    end

However, there are three key differences:

- Tuple types may have any number of parameters.
- Tuple types are *covariant* in their parameters: ``Tuple{Int}`` is a subtype
  of ``Tuple{Any}``. Therefore ``Tuple{Any}`` is considered an abstract type,
  and tuple types are only concrete if their parameters are.
- Tuples do not have field names; fields are only accessed by index.

Tuple values are written with parentheses and commas. When a tuple is constructed,
an appropriate tuple type is generated on demand:

.. doctest::

    julia> typeof((1,"foo",2.5))
    Tuple{Int64,String,Float64}

Note the implications of covariance:

.. doctest::

    julia> Tuple{Int,AbstractString} <: Tuple{Real,Any}
    true

    julia> Tuple{Int,AbstractString} <: Tuple{Real,Real}
    false

    julia> Tuple{Int,AbstractString} <: Tuple{Real,}
    false

Intuitively, this corresponds to the type of a function's arguments
being a subtype of the function's signature (when the signature matches).

Vararg Tuple Types
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The last parameter of a tuple type can be the special type ``Vararg``,
which denotes any number of trailing elements:

.. doctest::

    julia> isa(("1",), Tuple{AbstractString,Vararg{Int}})
    true

    julia> isa(("1",1), Tuple{AbstractString,Vararg{Int}})
    true

    julia> isa(("1",1,2), Tuple{AbstractString,Vararg{Int}})
    true

    julia> isa(("1",1,2,3.0), Tuple{AbstractString,Vararg{Int}})
    false

Notice that ``Vararg{T}`` corresponds to zero or more elements of type ``T``.
Vararg tuple types are used to represent the arguments accepted by varargs
methods (see :ref:`man-varargs-functions`).

The type ``Vararg{T,N}`` corresponds to exactly ``N`` elements of type ``T``.  ``NTuple{N,T}`` is
a convenient alias for ``Tuple{Vararg{T,N}}``, i.e. a tuple type containing exactly
``N`` elements of type ``T``.


.. _man-singleton-types:

Singleton Types
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

There is a special kind of abstract parametric type that must be
mentioned here: singleton types. For each type, ``T``, the "singleton
type" ``Type{T}`` is an abstract type whose only instance is the object
``T``. Since the definition is a little difficult to parse, let's look
at some examples:

.. doctest::

    julia> isa(Float64, Type{Float64})
    true

    julia> isa(Real, Type{Float64})
    false

    julia> isa(Real, Type{Real})
    true

    julia> isa(Float64, Type{Real})
    false

In other words, :func:`isa(A,Type{B}) <isa>` is true if and only if ``A`` and
``B`` are the same object and that object is a type. Without the
parameter, :obj:`Type` is simply an abstract type which has all type
objects as its instances, including, of course, singleton types:

.. doctest::

    julia> isa(Type{Float64},Type)
    true

    julia> isa(Float64,Type)
    true

    julia> isa(Real,Type)
    true

Any object that is not a type is not an instance of ``Type``:

.. doctest::

    julia> isa(1,Type)
    false

    julia> isa("foo",Type)
    false

Until we discuss :ref:`man-parametric-methods`
and :ref:`conversions <man-conversion>`, it is
difficult to explain the utility of the singleton type construct, but in
short, it allows one to specialize function behavior on specific type
*values*. This is useful for writing
methods (especially parametric ones) whose behavior depends on a type
that is given as an explicit argument rather than implied by the type of
one of its arguments.

A few popular languages have singleton types, including Haskell, Scala
and Ruby. In general usage, the term "singleton type" refers to a type
whose only instance is a single value. This meaning applies to Julia's
singleton types, but with that caveat that only type objects have
singleton types.

Parametric Bits Types
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Bits types can also be declared parametrically. For example, pointers
are represented as boxed bits types which would be declared in Julia
like this::

    # 32-bit system:
    bitstype 32 Ptr{T}

    # 64-bit system:
    bitstype 64 Ptr{T}

The slightly odd feature of these declarations as compared to typical
parametric composite types, is that the type parameter ``T`` is not used
in the definition of the type itself — it is just an abstract tag,
essentially defining an entire family of types with identical structure,
differentiated only by their type parameter. Thus, ``Ptr{Float64}`` and
``Ptr{Int64}`` are distinct types, even though they have identical
representations. And of course, all specific pointer types are subtype
of the umbrella ``Ptr`` type:

.. doctest::

    julia> Ptr{Float64} <: Ptr
    true

    julia> Ptr{Int64} <: Ptr
    true

Type Aliases
------------

Sometimes it is convenient to introduce a new name for an already
expressible type. For such occasions, Julia provides the ``typealias``
mechanism. For example, :class:`UInt` is type aliased to either :class:`UInt32` or
:class:`UInt64` as is appropriate for the size of pointers on the system::

    # 32-bit system:
    julia> UInt
    UInt32

    # 64-bit system:
    julia> UInt
    UInt64

This is accomplished via the following code in ``base/boot.jl``::

    if is(Int,Int64)
        typealias UInt UInt64
    else
        typealias UInt UInt32
    end

Of course, this depends on what :class:`Int` is aliased to — but that is
predefined to be the correct type — either :class:`Int32` or :class:`Int64`.

For parametric types, ``typealias`` can be convenient for providing
names for cases where some of the parameter choices are fixed.
Julia's arrays have type ``Array{T,N}`` where ``T`` is the element type
and ``N`` is the number of array dimensions. For convenience, writing
``Array{Float64}`` allows one to specify the element type without
specifying the dimension:

.. doctest::

    julia> Array{Float64,1} <: Array{Float64} <: Array
    true

However, there is no way to equally simply restrict just the dimension
but not the element type. Yet, one often needs to ensure an object
is a vector or a matrix (imposing restrictions on the number of dimensions).
For that reason, the following type aliases are provided::

    typealias Vector{T} Array{T,1}
    typealias Matrix{T} Array{T,2}

Writing ``Vector{Float64}`` is equivalent to writing
``Array{Float64,1}``, and the umbrella type ``Vector`` has as instances
all ``Array`` objects where the second parameter — the number of array
dimensions — is 1, regardless of what the element type is. In languages
where parametric types must always be specified in full, this is not
especially helpful, but in Julia, this allows one to write just
``Matrix`` for the abstract type including all two-dimensional dense
arrays of any element type.

This declaration of ``Vector`` creates a subtype relation
``Vector{Int} <: Vector``.  However, it is not always the case that a parametric
``typealias`` statement creates such a relation; for example, the statement::

    typealias AA{T} Array{Array{T,1},1}

does not create the relation ``AA{Int} <: AA``.  The reason is that ``Array{Array{T,1},1}`` is not
an abstract type at all; in fact, it is a concrete type describing a
1-dimensional array in which each entry
is an object of type ``Array{T,1}`` for some value of ``T``.

Operations on Types
-------------------

Since types in Julia are themselves objects, ordinary functions can
operate on them. Some functions that are particularly useful for working
with or exploring types have already been introduced, such as the ``<:``
operator, which indicates whether its left hand operand is a subtype of
its right hand operand.

The ``isa`` function tests if an object is of a given type and returns
true or false:

.. doctest::

    julia> isa(1,Int)
    true

    julia> isa(1,AbstractFloat)
    false

The :func:`typeof` function, already used throughout the manual in examples,
returns the type of its argument. Since, as noted above, types are
objects, they also have types, and we can ask what their types are:

.. doctest::

    julia> typeof(Rational)
    DataType

    julia> typeof(Union{Real,Float64,Rational})
    DataType

    julia> typeof(Union{Real,String})
    Union

What if we repeat the process? What is the type of a type of a type?
As it happens, types are all composite values and thus all have a type of
:obj:`DataType`:

.. doctest::

    julia> typeof(DataType)
    DataType

    julia> typeof(Union)
    DataType

:obj:`DataType` is its own type.

Another operation that applies to some types is :func:`supertype`, which
reveals a type's supertype.
Only declared types (:obj:`DataType`) have unambiguous supertypes:

.. doctest::

    julia> supertype(Float64)
    AbstractFloat

    julia> supertype(Number)
    Any

    julia> supertype(AbstractString)
    Any

    julia> supertype(Any)
    Any

If you apply :func:`supertype` to other type objects (or non-type objects), a
:exc:`MethodError` is raised::

    julia> supertype(Union{Float64,Int64})
    ERROR: `supertype` has no method matching supertype(::Type{Union{Float64,Int64}})

Custom pretty-printing
----------------------

Often, one wants to customize how instances of a type are displayed.  This
is accomplished by overloading the :func:`show` function.  For example,
suppose we define a type to represent complex numbers in polar form:

.. testcode::

    type Polar{T<:Real} <: Number
        r::T
        Θ::T
    end
    Polar(r::Real,Θ::Real) = Polar(promote(r,Θ)...)

.. testoutput::
   :hide:

   Polar{T<:Real}

Here, we've added a custom constructor function so that it can take arguments of
different ``Real`` types and promote them to a commmon type (see
:ref:`man-constructors` and :ref:`man-conversion-and-promotion`). (Of course, we
would have to define lots of other methods, too, to make it act like a
``Number``, e.g. ``+``, ``*``, ``one``, ``zero``, promotion rules and so on.) By
default, instances of this type display rather simply, with information about
the type name and the field values, as e.g. ``Polar{Float64}(3.0,4.0)``.

If we want it to display instead as ``3.0 * exp(4.0im)``, we would
define the following method to print the object to a given output
object ``io`` (representing a file, terminal, buffer, etcetera; see
:ref:`man-networking-and-streams`):

.. testcode::

    Base.show(io::IO, z::Polar) = print(io, z.r, " * exp(", z.Θ, "im)")

More fine-grained control over display of ``Polar`` objects is possible.
In particular, sometimes one wants both a verbose multi-line printing
format, used for displaying a single object in the REPL and other interactive
environments, and also a more compact single-line format used for :func:`print`
or for displaying the object as part of another object (e.g. in an array).
Although by default the ``show(io, z)`` function is called in both cases,
you can define a *different* multi-line format for displaying an object
by overloading a three-argument form of ``show`` that takes the ``text/plain``
MIME type as its second argument (see :ref:`man-multimedia-io`), for example:

.. testcode::

    Base.show{T}(io::IO, ::MIME"text/plain", z::Polar{T}) =
        print(io, "Polar{$T} complex number:\n   ", z)

(Note that ``print(..., z)`` here will call the 2-argument ``show(io, z)`` method.)
This results in:

.. doctest::

    julia> Polar(3, 4.0)
    Polar{Float64} complex number:
       3.0 * exp(4.0im)

    julia> [Polar(3, 4.0), Polar(4.0,5.3)]
    2-element Array{Polar{Float64},1}:
     3.0 * exp(4.0im)
     4.0 * exp(5.3im)

where the single-line ``show(io, z)`` form is still used for an array of ``Polar``
values.   Technically, the REPL calls ``display(z)`` to display the result of
executing a line, which defaults to ``show(STDOUT, MIME("text/plain"), z)``, which
in turn defaults to ``show(STDOUT, z)``, but you should *not* define new :func:`display`
methods unless you are defining a new multimedia display handler
(see :ref:`man-multimedia-io`).

Moreover, you can also define ``show`` methods for other MIME types in order
to enable richer display (HTML, images, etcetera) of objects in environments
that support this (e.g. IJulia).   For example, we can define formatted
HTML display of ``Polar`` objects, with superscripts and italics, via:

.. testcode::

    Base.show{T}(io::IO, ::MIME"text/html", z::Polar{T}) =
        println(io, "<code>Polar{$T}</code> complex number: ",
                z.r, " <i>e</i><sup>", z.Θ, " <i>i</i></sup>")

A ``Polar`` object will then display automatically using HTML in an environment
that supports HTML display, but you can call ``show`` manually to get HTML
output if you want:

.. doctest::

   julia> show(STDOUT, "text/html", Polar(3.0,4.0))
   <code>Polar{Float64}</code> complex number: 3.0 <i>e</i><sup>4.0 <i>i</i></sup>

.. raw:: html

   <p>An HTML renderer would display this as: <code>Polar{Float64}</code> complex number: 3.0 <i>e</i><sup>4.0 <i>i</i></sup></p>

.. _man-val-trick:

"Value types"
-------------

In Julia, you can't dispatch on a *value* such as ``true`` or
``false``. However, you can dispatch on parametric types, and Julia
allows you to include "plain bits" values (Types, Symbols,
Integers, floating-point numbers, tuples, etc.) as type parameters.  A
common example is the dimensionality parameter in ``Array{T,N}``,
where ``T`` is a type (e.g., ``Float64``) but ``N`` is just an
``Int``.

You can create your own custom types that take values as parameters,
and use them to control dispatch of custom types. By way of
illustration of this idea, let's introduce a parametric type,
``Val{T}``, which serves as a customary way to exploit this technique
for cases where you don't need a more elaborate hierarchy.

``Val`` is defined as::

    immutable Val{T}
    end

There is no more to the implementation of ``Val`` than this.  Some
functions in Julia's standard library accept ``Val`` types as
arguments, and you can also use it to write your own functions.  For
example:

.. testsetup:: value-types

    firstlast(::Type{Val{true}}) = "First";
    firstlast(::Type{Val{false}}) = "Last";

.. doctest:: value-types

    firstlast(::Type{Val{true}}) = "First"
    firstlast(::Type{Val{false}}) = "Last"

    julia> firstlast(Val{true})
    "First"

    julia> firstlast(Val{false})
    "Last"

For consistency across Julia, the call site should always pass a
``Val`` *type* rather than creating an *instance*, i.e., use
``foo(Val{:bar})`` rather than ``foo(Val{:bar}())``.

It's worth noting that it's extremely easy to mis-use parametric
"value" types, including ``Val``; in unfavorable cases, you can easily
end up making the performance of your code much *worse*.  In
particular, you would never want to write actual code as illustrated
above.  For more information about the proper (and improper) uses of
``Val``, please read the more extensive discussion in :ref:`the
performance tips <man-performance-val>`.

.. _man-nullable-types:

Nullable Types: Representing Missing Values
-------------------------------------------

In many settings, you need to interact with a value of type ``T`` that may or
may not exist. To handle these settings, Julia provides a parametric type
called ``Nullable{T}``, which can be thought of as a specialized container
type that can contain either zero or one values. ``Nullable{T}`` provides a
minimal interface designed to ensure that interactions with missing values
are safe. At present, the interface consists of four possible interactions:

- Construct a :obj:`Nullable` object.
- Check if a :obj:`Nullable` object has a missing value.
- Access the value of a :obj:`Nullable` object with a guarantee that a
  :exc:`NullException` will be thrown if the object's value is missing.
- Access the value of a :obj:`Nullable` object with a guarantee that a default
  value of type ``T`` will be returned if the object's value is missing.

Constructing :obj:`Nullable` objects
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To construct an object representing a missing value of type ``T``, use the
``Nullable{T}()`` function:

.. doctest::

    julia> x1 = Nullable{Int64}()
    Nullable{Int64}()

    julia> x2 = Nullable{Float64}()
    Nullable{Float64}()

    julia> x3 = Nullable{Vector{Int64}}()
    Nullable{Array{Int64,1}}()

To construct an object representing a non-missing value of type ``T``, use the
``Nullable(x::T)`` function:

.. doctest::

    julia> x1 = Nullable(1)
    Nullable{Int64}(1)

    julia> x2 = Nullable(1.0)
    Nullable{Float64}(1.0)

    julia> x3 = Nullable([1, 2, 3])
    Nullable{Array{Int64,1}}([1,2,3])

Note the core distinction between these two ways of constructing a :obj:`Nullable`
object: in one style, you provide a type, ``T``, as a function parameter; in
the other style, you provide a single value of type ``T`` as an argument.

Checking if a :obj:`Nullable` object has a value
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can check if a :obj:`Nullable` object has any value using :func:`isnull`:

.. doctest::

    julia> isnull(Nullable{Float64}())
    true

    julia> isnull(Nullable(0.0))
    false

Safely accessing the value of a :obj:`Nullable` object
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can safely access the value of a :obj:`Nullable` object using :func:`get`:

.. doctest::

    julia> get(Nullable{Float64}())
    ERROR: NullException()
     in get(::Nullable{Float64}) at ./nullable.jl:91
     ...

    julia> get(Nullable(1.0))
    1.0

If the value is not present, as it would be for ``Nullable{Float64}``, a
:exc:`NullException` error will be thrown. The error-throwing nature of the
:func:`get` function ensures that any attempt to access a missing value immediately
fails.

In cases for which a reasonable default value exists that could be used
when a :obj:`Nullable` object's value turns out to be missing, you can provide this
default value as a second argument to :func:`get`:

.. doctest::

    julia> get(Nullable{Float64}(), 0.0)
    0.0

    julia> get(Nullable(1.0), 0.0)
    1.0

.. tip::

    Make sure the type of the default value passed to :func:`get` and that of the
    :obj:`Nullable` object match to avoid type instability, which could hurt
    performance. Use :func:`convert` manually if needed.
