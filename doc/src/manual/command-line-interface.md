# Command-line Interface

## Using arguments inside scripts

When running a script using `julia`, you can pass additional arguments to your script:

```
$ julia script.jl arg1 arg2...
```

These additional command-line arguments are passed in the global constant `ARGS`. The
name of the script itself is passed in as the global `PROGRAM_FILE`. Note that `ARGS` is
also set when a Julia expression is given using the `-e` option on the command line (see the
`julia` help output below) but `PROGRAM_FILE` will be empty. For example, to just print the
arguments given to a script, you could do this:

```
$ julia -e 'println(PROGRAM_FILE); for x in ARGS; println(x); end' foo bar

foo
bar
```

Or you could put that code into a script and run it:

```
$ echo 'println(PROGRAM_FILE); for x in ARGS; println(x); end' > script.jl
$ julia script.jl foo bar
script.jl
foo
bar
```

The `--` delimiter can be used to separate command-line arguments intended for the script file from arguments intended for Julia:

```
$ julia --color=yes -O -- script.jl arg1 arg2..
```

See also [Scripting](@ref man-scripting) for more information on writing Julia scripts.


## Parallel mode

Julia can be started in parallel mode with either the `-p` or the `--machine-file` options. `-p n`
will launch an additional `n` worker processes, while `--machine-file file` will launch a worker
for each line in file `file`. The machines defined in `file` must be accessible via a password-less
`ssh` login, with Julia installed at the same location as the current host. Each machine definition
takes the form `[count*][user@]host[:port] [bind_addr[:port]]`. `user` defaults to current user,
`port` to the standard ssh port. `count` is the number of workers to spawn on the node, and defaults
to 1. The optional `bind-to bind_addr[:port]` specifies the IP address and port that other workers
should use to connect to this worker.


## Startup file

If you have code that you want executed whenever Julia is run, you can put it in
`~/.julia/config/startup.jl`:

```
$ echo 'println("Greetings! 你好! 안녕하세요?")' > ~/.julia/config/startup.jl
$ julia
Greetings! 你好! 안녕하세요?

...
```

Note that although you should have a `~/.julia` directory once you've run Julia for the
first time, you may need to create the `~/.julia/config` folder and the
`~/.julia/config/startup.jl` file if you use it.

To have startup code run only in [The Julia REPL] (and not when `julia` is *e.g.* run
on a script), use [`atreplinit`](@ref) in `startup.jl`:

```julia
atreplinit() do repl
    # ...
end
```


## [Command-line switches for Julia](@id command-line-interface)

There are various ways to run Julia code and provide options, similar to those available for the
`perl` and `ruby` programs:

```
julia [switches] -- [programfile] [args...]
```

The following is a complete list of command-line switches available when launching julia (a '*' marks the default value, if applicable):

|Switch                                 |Description|
|:---                                   |:---|
|`-v`, `--version`                      |Display version information|
|`-h`, `--help`                         |Print command-line options (this message).|
|`--help-hidden`                        |Uncommon options not shown by `-h`|
|`--project[={<dir>\|@.}]`              |Set `<dir>` as the home project/environment. The default `@.` option will search through parent directories until a `Project.toml` or `JuliaProject.toml` file is found.|
|`-J`, `--sysimage <file>`              |Start up with the given system image file|
|`-H`, `--home <dir>`                   |Set location of `julia` executable|
|`--startup-file={yes*\|no}`            |Load `JULIA_DEPOT_PATH/config/startup.jl`; if `JULIA_DEPOT_PATH` environment variable is unset, load `~/.julia/config/startup.jl`|
|`--handle-signals={yes*\|no}`          |Enable or disable Julia's default signal handlers|
|`--sysimage-native-code={yes*\|no}`    |Use native code from system image if available|
|`--compiled-modules={yes*\|no}`        |Enable or disable incremental precompilation of modules|
|`-e`, `--eval <expr>`                  |Evaluate `<expr>`|
|`-E`, `--print <expr>`                 |Evaluate `<expr>` and display the result|
|`-L`, `--load <file>`                  |Load `<file>` immediately on all processors|
|`-t`, `--threads {N\|auto`}            |Enable N threads; `auto` tries to infer a useful default number of threads to use but the exact behavior might change in the future.  Currently, `auto` uses the number of CPUs assigned to this julia process based on the OS-specific affinity assignment interface, if supported (Linux and Windows). If this is not supported (macOS) or process affinity is not configured, it uses the number of CPU threads.|
|`-p`, `--procs {N\|auto`}              |Integer value N launches N additional local worker processes; `auto` launches as many workers as the number of local CPU threads (logical cores)|
|`--machine-file <file>`                |Run processes on hosts listed in `<file>`|
|`-i`                                   |Interactive mode; REPL runs and `isinteractive()` is true|
|`-q`, `--quiet`                        |Quiet startup: no banner, suppress REPL warnings|
|`--banner={yes\|no\|auto*}`            |Enable or disable startup banner|
|`--color={yes\|no\|auto*}`             |Enable or disable color text|
|`--history-file={yes*\|no}`            |Load or save history|
|`--depwarn={yes\|no*\|error}`          |Enable or disable syntax and method deprecation warnings (`error` turns warnings into errors)|
|`--warn-overwrite={yes\|no*}`          |Enable or disable method overwrite warnings|
|`--warn-scope={yes*\|no}`              |Enable or disable warning for ambiguous top-level scope|
|`-C`, `--cpu-target <target>`          |Limit usage of CPU features up to `<target>`; set to `help` to see the available options|
|`-O`, `--optimize={0,1,2*,3}`          |Set the optimization level (level is 3 if `-O` is used without a level)|
|`--min-optlevel={0*,1,2,3}`            |Set the lower bound on per-module optimization|
|`-g {0,1*,2}`                          |Set the level of debug info generation (level is 2 if `-g` is used without a level)|
|`--inline={yes\|no}`                   |Control whether inlining is permitted, including overriding `@inline` declarations|
|`--check-bounds={yes\|no\|auto*}`      |Emit bounds checks always, never, or respect `@inbounds` declarations|
|`--math-mode={ieee,fast}`              |Disallow or enable unsafe floating point optimizations (overrides `@fastmath` declaration)|
|`--code-coverage[={none*\|user\|all}]` |Count executions of source lines (omitting setting is equivalent to `user`)|
|`--code-coverage=tracefile.info`       |Append coverage information to the LCOV tracefile (filename supports format tokens).|
|`--track-allocation[={none*\|user\|all}]` |Count bytes allocated by each source line (omitting setting is equivalent to "user")|
|`--bug-report=KIND`                    |Launch a bug report session. It can be used to start a REPL, run a script, or evaluate expressions. It first tries to use BugReporting.jl installed in current environment and falls back to the latest compatible BugReporting.jl if not. For more information, see `--bug-report=help`.|
|`--compile={yes*\|no\|all\|min}`       |Enable or disable JIT compiler, or request exhaustive or minimal compilation|
|`--output-o <name>`                    |Generate an object file (including system image data)|
|`--output-ji <name>`                   |Generate a system image data file (.ji)|
|`--strip-metadata`                     |Remove docstrings and source location info from system image|
|`--strip-ir`                           |Remove IR (intermediate representation) of compiled functions|
|`--output-unopt-bc <name>`             |Generate unoptimized LLVM bitcode (.bc)|
|`--output-bc <name>`                   |Generate LLVM bitcode (.bc)|
|`--output-asm <name>`                  |Generate an assembly file (.s)|
|`--output-incremental={yes\|no*}`      |Generate an incremental output file (rather than complete)|
|`--trace-compile={stderr,name}`        |Print precompile statements for methods compiled during execution or save to a path|
|`--image-codegen`                      |Force generate code in imaging mode|


!!! compat "Julia 1.1"
    In Julia 1.0, the default `--project=@.` option did not search up from the root
    directory of a Git repository for the `Project.toml` file. From Julia 1.1 forward, it
    does.
