# Metaprogramming

The strongest legacy of Lisp in the Julia language is its metaprogramming support. Like Lisp,
Julia represents its own code as a data structure of the language itself. Since code is represented
by objects that can be created and manipulated from within the language, it is possible for a
program to transform and generate its own code. This allows sophisticated code generation without
extra build steps, and also allows true Lisp-style macros operating at the level of [abstract syntax trees](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_syntax_tree).
In contrast, preprocessor "macro" systems, like that of C and C++, perform textual manipulation
and substitution before any actual parsing or interpretation occurs. Because all data types and
code in Julia are represented by Julia data structures, powerful [reflection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reflection_%28computer_programming%29)
capabilities are available to explore the internals of a program and its types just like any other
data.

## Program representation

Every Julia program starts life as a string:

```jldoctest prog
julia> prog = "1 + 1"
"1 + 1"
```

**What happens next?**

The next step is to [parse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parsing#Computer_languages) each string
into an object called an expression, represented by the Julia type [`Expr`](@ref):

```jldoctest prog
julia> ex1 = Meta.parse(prog)
:(1 + 1)

julia> typeof(ex1)
Expr
```

`Expr` objects contain two parts:

  * a [`Symbol`](@ref) identifying the kind of expression. A symbol is an [interned string](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/String_interning)
    identifier (more discussion below).

```jldoctest prog
julia> ex1.head
:call
```

  * the expression arguments, which may be symbols, other expressions, or literal values:

```jldoctest prog
julia> ex1.args
3-element Array{Any,1}:
  :+
 1
 1
```

Expressions may also be constructed directly in [prefix notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polish_notation):

```jldoctest prog
julia> ex2 = Expr(:call, :+, 1, 1)
:(1 + 1)
```

The two expressions constructed above – by parsing and by direct construction – are equivalent:

```jldoctest prog
julia> ex1 == ex2
true
```

**The key point here is that Julia code is internally represented as a data structure that is accessible
from the language itself.**

The [`dump`](@ref) function provides indented and annotated display of `Expr` objects:

```jldoctest prog
julia> dump(ex2)
Expr
  head: Symbol call
  args: Array{Any}((3,))
    1: Symbol +
    2: Int64 1
    3: Int64 1
```

`Expr` objects may also be nested:

```jldoctest ex3
julia> ex3 = Meta.parse("(4 + 4) / 2")
:((4 + 4) / 2)
```

Another way to view expressions is with `Meta.show_sexpr`, which displays the [S-expression](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S-expression)
form of a given `Expr`, which may look very familiar to users of Lisp. Here's an example illustrating
the display on a nested `Expr`:

```jldoctest ex3
julia> Meta.show_sexpr(ex3)
(:call, :/, (:call, :+, 4, 4), 2)
```

### Symbols

The `:` character has two syntactic purposes in Julia. The first form creates a [`Symbol`](@ref),
an [interned string](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/String_interning) used as one building-block
of expressions:

```jldoctest
julia> :foo
:foo

julia> typeof(ans)
Symbol
```

The [`Symbol`](@ref) constructor takes any number of arguments and creates a new symbol by concatenating
their string representations together:

```jldoctest
julia> :foo == Symbol("foo")
true

julia> Symbol("func",10)
:func10

julia> Symbol(:var,'_',"sym")
:var_sym
```

In the context of an expression, symbols are used to indicate access to variables; when an expression
is evaluated, a symbol is replaced with the value bound to that symbol in the appropriate [scope](@ref scope-of-variables).

Sometimes extra parentheses around the argument to `:` are needed to avoid ambiguity in parsing:

```jldoctest
julia> :(:)
:(:)

julia> :(::)
:(::)
```

## Expressions and evaluation

### Quoting

The second syntactic purpose of the `:` character is to create expression objects without using
the explicit [`Expr`](@ref) constructor. This is referred to as *quoting*. The `:` character, followed
by paired parentheses around a single statement of Julia code, produces an `Expr` object based
on the enclosed code. Here is example of the short form used to quote an arithmetic expression:

```jldoctest
julia> ex = :(a+b*c+1)
:(a + b * c + 1)

julia> typeof(ex)
Expr
```

(to view the structure of this expression, try `ex.head` and `ex.args`, or use [`dump`](@ref)
as above or [`Meta.@dump`](@ref))

Note that equivalent expressions may be constructed using [`Meta.parse`](@ref) or the direct `Expr`
form:

```jldoctest
julia>      :(a + b*c + 1)       ==
       Meta.parse("a + b*c + 1") ==
       Expr(:call, :+, :a, Expr(:call, :*, :b, :c), 1)
true
```

Expressions provided by the parser generally only have symbols, other expressions, and literal
values as their args, whereas expressions constructed by Julia code can have arbitrary run-time
values without literal forms as args. In this specific example, `+` and `a` are symbols, `*(b,c)`
is a subexpression, and `1` is a literal 64-bit signed integer.

There is a second syntactic form of quoting for multiple expressions: blocks of code enclosed
in `quote ... end`.

```jldoctest
julia> ex = quote
           x = 1
           y = 2
           x + y
       end
quote
    #= none:2 =#
    x = 1
    #= none:3 =#
    y = 2
    #= none:4 =#
    x + y
end

julia> typeof(ex)
Expr
```

### Interpolation

Direct construction of [`Expr`](@ref) objects with value arguments is powerful, but `Expr` constructors
can be tedious compared to "normal" Julia syntax. As an alternative, Julia allows *interpolation* of
literals or expressions into quoted expressions. Interpolation is indicated by a prefix `$`.

In this example, the value of variable `a` is interpolated:

```jldoctest interp1
julia> a = 1;

julia> ex = :($a + b)
:(1 + b)
```

Interpolating into an unquoted expression is not supported and will cause a compile-time error:

```jldoctest interp1
julia> $a + b
ERROR: syntax: "$" expression outside quote
```

In this example, the tuple `(1,2,3)` is interpolated as an expression into a conditional test:

```jldoctest interp1
julia> ex = :(a in $:((1,2,3)) )
:(a in (1, 2, 3))
```

The use of `$` for expression interpolation is intentionally reminiscent of [string interpolation](@ref string-interpolation)
and [command interpolation](@ref command-interpolation). Expression interpolation allows convenient, readable programmatic
construction of complex Julia expressions.

### Splatting interpolation

Notice that the `$` interpolation syntax allows inserting only a single expression into an
enclosing expression.
Occasionally, you have an array of expressions and need them all to become arguments of
the surrounding expression.
This can be done with the syntax `$(xs...)`.
For example, the following code generates a function call where the number of arguments is
determined programmatically:

```jldoctest interp1
julia> args = [:x, :y, :z];

julia> :(f(1, $(args...)))
:(f(1, x, y, z))
```

### Nested quote

Naturally, it is possible for quote expressions to contain other quote expressions.
Understanding how interpolation works in these cases can be a bit tricky.
Consider this example:

```jldoctest interp1
julia> x = :(1 + 2);

julia> e = quote quote $x end end
quote
    #= none:1 =#
    $(Expr(:quote, quote
    #= none:1 =#
    $(Expr(:$, :x))
end))
end
```

Notice that the result contains `Expr(:$, :x)`, which means that `x` has not been
evaluated yet.
In other words, the `$` expression "belongs to" the inner quote expression, and
so its argument is only evaluated when the inner quote expression is:

```jldoctest interp1
julia> eval(e)
quote
    #= none:1 =#
    1 + 2
end
```

However, the outer `quote` expression is able to interpolate values inside the `$`
in the inner quote.
This is done with multiple `$`s:

```jldoctest interp1
julia> e = quote quote $$x end end
quote
    #= none:1 =#
    $(Expr(:quote, quote
    #= none:1 =#
    $(Expr(:$, :(1 + 2)))
end))
end
```

Notice that `:(1 + 2)` now appears in the result instead of the symbol `:x`.
Evaluating this expression yields an interpolated `3`:

```jldoctest interp1
julia> eval(e)
quote
    #= none:1 =#
    3
end
```

The intuition behind this behavior is that `x` is evaluated once for each `$`:
one `$` works similarly to `eval(:x)`, giving `x`'s value, while two `$`s do the
equivalent of `eval(eval(:x))`.

### [QuoteNode](@id man-quote-node)

The usual representation of a `quote` form in an AST is an [`Expr`](@ref) with head `:quote`:

```jldoctest interp1
julia> dump(Meta.parse(":(1+2)"))
Expr
  head: Symbol quote
  args: Array{Any}((1,))
    1: Expr
      head: Symbol call
      args: Array{Any}((3,))
        1: Symbol +
        2: Int64 1
        3: Int64 2
```

As we have seen, such expressions support interpolation with `$`.
However, in some situations it is necessary to quote code *without* performing interpolation.
This kind of quoting does not yet have syntax, but is represented internally
as an object of type `QuoteNode`:
```jldoctest interp1
julia> eval(quot(Expr(:$, :(1+2))))
3

julia> eval(QuoteNode(Expr(:$, :(1+2))))
:($(Expr(:$, :(1 + 2))))
```
The parser yields `QuoteNode`s for simple quoted items like symbols:
```jldoctest interp1
julia> dump(Meta.parse(":x"))
QuoteNode
  value: Symbol x
```

`QuoteNode` can also be used for certain advanced metaprogramming tasks.

### [`eval`](@ref) and effects

Given an expression object, one can cause Julia to evaluate (execute) it at global scope using
[`eval`](@ref):

```jldoctest interp1
julia> :(1 + 2)
:(1 + 2)

julia> eval(ans)
3

julia> ex = :(a + b)
:(a + b)

julia> eval(ex)
ERROR: UndefVarError: b not defined
[...]

julia> a = 1; b = 2;

julia> eval(ex)
3
```

Every [module](@ref modules) has its own [`eval`](@ref) function that evaluates expressions in its global
scope. Expressions passed to [`eval`](@ref) are not limited to returning values -- they can
also have side-effects that alter the state of the enclosing module's environment:

```jldoctest
julia> ex = :(x = 1)
:(x = 1)

julia> x
ERROR: UndefVarError: x not defined

julia> eval(ex)
1

julia> x
1
```

Here, the evaluation of an expression object causes a value to be assigned to the global variable
`x`.

Since expressions are just `Expr` objects which can be constructed programmatically and then evaluated,
it is possible to dynamically generate arbitrary code which can then be run using [`eval`](@ref).
Here is a simple example:

```julia-repl
julia> a = 1;

julia> ex = Expr(:call, :+, a, :b)
:(1 + b)

julia> a = 0; b = 2;

julia> eval(ex)
3
```

The value of `a` is used to construct the expression `ex` which applies the `+` function to the
value 1 and the variable `b`. Note the important distinction between the way `a` and `b` are used:

  * The value of the *variable* `a` at expression construction time is used as an immediate value in
    the expression. Thus, the value of `a` when the expression is evaluated no longer matters: the
    value in the expression is already `1`, independent of whatever the value of `a` might be.
  * On the other hand, the *symbol* `:b` is used in the expression construction, so the value of the
    variable `b` at that time is irrelevant -- `:b` is just a symbol and the variable `b` need not
    even be defined. At expression evaluation time, however, the value of the symbol `:b` is resolved
    by looking up the value of the variable `b`.

### Functions on `Expr`essions

As hinted above, one extremely useful feature of Julia is the capability to generate and manipulate
Julia code within Julia itself. We have already seen one example of a function returning [`Expr`](@ref)
objects: the [`parse`](@ref) function, which takes a string of Julia code and returns the corresponding
`Expr`. A function can also take one or more `Expr` objects as arguments, and return another
`Expr`. Here is a simple, motivating example:

```jldoctest
julia> function math_expr(op, op1, op2)
           expr = Expr(:call, op, op1, op2)
           return expr
       end
math_expr (generic function with 1 method)

julia>  ex = math_expr(:+, 1, Expr(:call, :*, 4, 5))
:(1 + 4 * 5)

julia> eval(ex)
21
```

As another example, here is a function that doubles any numeric argument, but leaves expressions
alone:

```jldoctest
julia> function make_expr2(op, opr1, opr2)
           opr1f, opr2f = map(x -> isa(x, Number) ? 2*x : x, (opr1, opr2))
           retexpr = Expr(:call, op, opr1f, opr2f)
           return retexpr
       end
make_expr2 (generic function with 1 method)

julia> make_expr2(:+, 1, 2)
:(2 + 4)

julia> ex = make_expr2(:+, 1, Expr(:call, :*, 5, 8))
:(2 + 5 * 8)

julia> eval(ex)
42
```

## [Macros](@id man-macros)

Macros provide a method to include generated code in the final body of a program. A macro maps
a tuple of arguments to a returned *expression*, and the resulting expression is compiled directly
rather than requiring a runtime [`eval`](@ref) call. Macro arguments may include expressions,
literal values, and symbols.

### Basics

Here is an extraordinarily simple macro:

```jldoctest sayhello
julia> macro sayhello()
           return :( println("Hello, world!") )
       end
@sayhello (macro with 1 method)
```

Macros have a dedicated character in Julia's syntax: the `@` (at-sign), followed by the unique
name declared in a `macro NAME ... end` block. In this example, the compiler will replace all
instances of `@sayhello` with:

```julia
:( println("Hello, world!") )
```

When `@sayhello` is entered in the REPL, the expression executes immediately, thus we only see the
evaluation result:

```jldoctest sayhello
julia> @sayhello()
Hello, world!
```

Now, consider a slightly more complex macro:

```jldoctest sayhello2
julia> macro sayhello(name)
           return :( println("Hello, ", $name) )
       end
@sayhello (macro with 1 method)
```

This macro takes one argument: `name`. When `@sayhello` is encountered, the quoted expression
is *expanded* to interpolate the value of the argument into the final expression:

```jldoctest sayhello2
julia> @sayhello("human")
Hello, human
```

We can view the quoted return expression using the function [`macroexpand`](@ref) (**important note:**
this is an extremely useful tool for debugging macros):

```julia-repl sayhello2
julia> ex = macroexpand(Main, :(@sayhello("human")) )
:(Main.println("Hello, ", "human"))

julia> typeof(ex)
Expr
```

We can see that the `"human"` literal has been interpolated into the expression.

There also exists a macro [`@macroexpand`](@ref) that is perhaps a bit more convenient than the `macroexpand` function:


```jldoctest sayhello2
julia> @macroexpand @sayhello "human"
:(println("Hello, ", "human"))
```

### Hold up: why macros?

We have already seen a function `f(::Expr...) -> Expr` in a previous section. In fact, [`macroexpand`](@ref)
is also such a function. So, why do macros exist?

Macros are necessary because they execute when code is parsed, therefore, macros allow the programmer
to generate and include fragments of customized code *before* the full program is run. To illustrate
the difference, consider the following example:

```julia-repl whymacros
julia> macro twostep(arg)
           println("I execute at parse time. The argument is: ", arg)
           return :(println("I execute at runtime. The argument is: ", $arg))
       end
@twostep (macro with 1 method)

julia> ex = macroexpand(Main, :(@twostep :(1, 2, 3)) );
I execute at parse time. The argument is: $(Expr(:quote, :((1, 2, 3))))
```

The first call to [`println`](@ref) is executed when [`macroexpand`](@ref) is called. The
resulting expression contains *only* the second `println`:

```julia-repl whymacros
julia> typeof(ex)
Expr

julia> ex
:(println("I execute at runtime. The argument is: ", $(Expr(:copyast, :($(QuoteNode(:((1, 2, 3)))))))))

julia> eval(ex)
I execute at runtime. The argument is: (1, 2, 3)
```

### Macro invocation

Macros are invoked with the following general syntax:

```julia
@name expr1 expr2 ...
@name(expr1, expr2, ...)
```

Note the distinguishing `@` before the macro name and the lack of commas between the argument
expressions in the first form, and the lack of whitespace after `@name` in the second form. The
two styles should not be mixed. For example, the following syntax is different from the examples
above; it passes the tuple `(expr1, expr2, ...)` as one argument to the macro:

```julia
@name (expr1, expr2, ...)
```

An alternative way to invoke a macro over an array literal (or comprehension) is to juxtapose both without using parentheses. In this case, the array will be the only expression fed to the macro. The following syntax is equivalent (and different from `@name [a b] * v`):

```julia
@name[a b] * v
@name([a b]) * v
```

It is important to emphasize that macros receive their arguments as expressions, literals, or
symbols. One way to explore macro arguments is to call the [`show`](@ref) function within the
macro body:

```jldoctest
julia> macro showarg(x)
           show(x)
           # ... remainder of macro, returning an expression
       end
@showarg (macro with 1 method)

julia> @showarg(a)
:a

julia> @showarg(1+1)
:(1 + 1)

julia> @showarg(println("Yo!"))
:(println("Yo!"))
```

In addition to the given argument list, every macro is passed extra arguments named `__source__` and `__module__`.

The argument `__source__` provides information (in the form of a `LineNumberNode` object) about the parser location
of the `@` sign from the macro invocation.
This allows macros to include better error diagnostic information,
and is commonly used by logging, string-parser macros, and docs, for example,
as well as to implement the [`@__LINE__`](@ref), [`@__FILE__`](@ref), and [`@__DIR__`](@ref) macros.

The location information can be accessed by referencing `__source__.line` and `__source__.file`:

```jldoctest
julia> macro __LOCATION__(); return QuoteNode(__source__); end
@__LOCATION__ (macro with 1 method)

julia> dump(
            @__LOCATION__(
       ))
LineNumberNode
  line: Int64 2
  file: Symbol none
```

The argument `__module__` provides information (in the form of a `Module` object)
about the expansion context of the macro invocation.
This allows macros to look up contextual information, such as existing bindings,
or to insert the value as an extra argument to a runtime function call doing self-reflection
in the current module.


### Building an advanced macro

Here is a simplified definition of Julia's [`@assert`](@ref) macro:

```jldoctest building
julia> macro assert(ex)
           return :( $ex ? nothing : throw(AssertionError($(string(ex)))) )
       end
@assert (macro with 1 method)
```

This macro can be used like this:

```jldoctest building
julia> @assert 1 == 1.0

julia> @assert 1 == 0
ERROR: AssertionError: 1 == 0
```

In place of the written syntax, the macro call is expanded at parse time to its returned result.
This is equivalent to writing:

```julia
1 == 1.0 ? nothing : throw(AssertionError("1 == 1.0"))
1 == 0 ? nothing : throw(AssertionError("1 == 0"))
```

That is, in the first call, the expression `:(1 == 1.0)` is spliced into the test condition slot,
while the value of `string(:(1 == 1.0))` is spliced into the assertion message slot. The entire
expression, thus constructed, is placed into the syntax tree where the `@assert` macro call occurs.
Then at execution time, if the test expression evaluates to true, then [`nothing`](@ref) is returned,
whereas if the test is false, an error is raised indicating the asserted expression that was false.
Notice that it would not be possible to write this as a function, since only the *value* of the
condition is available and it would be impossible to display the expression that computed it in
the error message.

The actual definition of `@assert` in Julia Base is more complicated. It allows the
user to optionally specify their own error message, instead of just printing the failed expression.
Just like in functions with a variable number of arguments ([Varargs Functions](@ref)), this is specified with an ellipses
following the last argument:

```jldoctest assert2
julia> macro assert(ex, msgs...)
           msg_body = isempty(msgs) ? ex : msgs[1]
           msg = string(msg_body)
           return :($ex ? nothing : throw(AssertionError($msg)))
       end
@assert (macro with 1 method)
```

Now `@assert` has two modes of operation, depending upon the number of arguments it receives!
If there's only one argument, the tuple of expressions captured by `msgs` will be empty and it
will behave the same as the simpler definition above. But now if the user specifies a second argument,
it is printed in the message body instead of the failing expression. You can inspect the result
of a macro expansion with the aptly named [`@macroexpand`](@ref) macro:

```julia-repl assert2
julia> @macroexpand @assert a == b
:(if Main.a == Main.b
        Main.nothing
    else
        Main.throw(Main.AssertionError("a == b"))
    end)

julia> @macroexpand @assert a==b "a should equal b!"
:(if Main.a == Main.b
        Main.nothing
    else
        Main.throw(Main.AssertionError("a should equal b!"))
    end)
```

There is yet another case that the actual `@assert` macro handles: what if, in addition to printing
"a should equal b," we wanted to print their values? One might naively try to use string interpolation
in the custom message, e.g., `@assert a==b "a ($a) should equal b ($b)!"`, but this won't work
as expected with the above macro. Can you see why? Recall from [string interpolation](@ref string-interpolation) that
an interpolated string is rewritten to a call to [`string`](@ref). Compare:

```jldoctest
julia> typeof(:("a should equal b"))
String

julia> typeof(:("a ($a) should equal b ($b)!"))
Expr

julia> dump(:("a ($a) should equal b ($b)!"))
Expr
  head: Symbol string
  args: Array{Any}((5,))
    1: String "a ("
    2: Symbol a
    3: String ") should equal b ("
    4: Symbol b
    5: String ")!"
```

So now instead of getting a plain string in `msg_body`, the macro is receiving a full expression
that will need to be evaluated in order to display as expected. This can be spliced directly into
the returned expression as an argument to the [`string`](@ref) call; see [`error.jl`](https://github.com/JuliaLang/julia/blob/master/base/error.jl)
for the complete implementation.

The `@assert` macro makes great use of splicing into quoted expressions to simplify the manipulation
of expressions inside the macro body.

### Hygiene

An issue that arises in more complex macros is that of [hygiene](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hygienic_macro).
In short, macros must ensure that the variables they introduce in their returned expressions do
not accidentally clash with existing variables in the surrounding code they expand into. Conversely,
the expressions that are passed into a macro as arguments are often *expected* to evaluate in
the context of the surrounding code, interacting with and modifying the existing variables. Another
concern arises from the fact that a macro may be called in a different module from where it was
defined. In this case we need to ensure that all global variables are resolved to the correct
module. Julia already has a major advantage over languages with textual macro expansion (like
C) in that it only needs to consider the returned expression. All the other variables (such as
`msg` in `@assert` above) follow the [normal scoping block behavior](@ref scope-of-variables).

To demonstrate these issues, let us consider writing a `@time` macro that takes an expression
as its argument, records the time, evaluates the expression, records the time again, prints the
difference between the before and after times, and then has the value of the expression as its
final value. The macro might look like this:

```julia
macro time(ex)
    return quote
        local t0 = time()
        local val = $ex
        local t1 = time()
        println("elapsed time: ", t1-t0, " seconds")
        val
    end
end
```

Here, we want `t0`, `t1`, and `val` to be private temporary variables, and we want `time` to refer
to the [`time`](@ref) function in Julia Base, not to any `time` variable the user
might have (the same applies to `println`). Imagine the problems that could occur if the user
expression `ex` also contained assignments to a variable called `t0`, or defined its own `time`
variable. We might get errors, or mysteriously incorrect behavior.

Julia's macro expander solves these problems in the following way. First, variables within a macro
result are classified as either local or global. A variable is considered local if it is assigned
to (and not declared global), declared local, or used as a function argument name. Otherwise,
it is considered global. Local variables are then renamed to be unique (using the [`gensym`](@ref)
function, which generates new symbols), and global variables are resolved within the macro definition
environment. Therefore both of the above concerns are handled; the macro's locals will not conflict
with any user variables, and `time` and `println` will refer to the Julia Base definitions.

One problem remains however. Consider the following use of this macro:

```julia
module MyModule
import Base.@time

time() = ... # compute something

@time time()
end
```

Here the user expression `ex` is a call to `time`, but not the same `time` function that the macro
uses. It clearly refers to `MyModule.time`. Therefore we must arrange for the code in `ex` to
be resolved in the macro call environment. This is done by "escaping" the expression with [`esc`](@ref):

```julia
macro time(ex)
    ...
    local val = $(esc(ex))
    ...
end
```

An expression wrapped in this manner is left alone by the macro expander and simply pasted into
the output verbatim. Therefore it will be resolved in the macro call environment.

This escaping mechanism can be used to "violate" hygiene when necessary, in order to introduce
or manipulate user variables. For example, the following macro sets `x` to zero in the call environment:

```jldoctest
julia> macro zerox()
           return esc(:(x = 0))
       end
@zerox (macro with 1 method)

julia> function foo()
           x = 1
           @zerox
           return x # is zero
       end
foo (generic function with 1 method)

julia> foo()
0
```

This kind of manipulation of variables should be used judiciously, but is occasionally quite handy.

Getting the hygiene rules correct can be a formidable challenge.
Before using a macro, you might want to consider whether a function closure
would be sufficient. Another useful strategy is to defer as much work as possible to runtime.
For example, many macros simply wrap their arguments in a `QuoteNode` or other similar [`Expr`](@ref).
Some examples of this include `@task body` which simply returns `schedule(Task(() -> $body))`,
and `@eval expr`, which simply returns `eval(QuoteNode(expr))`.

To demonstrate, we might rewrite the `@time` example above as:

```julia
macro time(expr)
    return :(timeit(() -> $(esc(expr))))
end
function timeit(f)
    t0 = time()
    val = f()
    t1 = time()
    println("elapsed time: ", t1-t0, " seconds")
    return val
end
```

However, we don't do this for a good reason: wrapping the `expr` in a new scope block (the anonymous function)
also slightly changes the meaning of the expression (the scope of any variables in it),
while we want `@time` to be usable with minimum impact on the wrapped code.

### Macros and dispatch

Macros, just like Julia functions, are generic. This means they can also have multiple method definitions, thanks to multiple dispatch:
```jldoctest macromethods
julia> macro m end
@m (macro with 0 methods)

julia> macro m(args...)
           println("$(length(args)) arguments")
       end
@m (macro with 1 method)

julia> macro m(x,y)
           println("Two arguments")
       end
@m (macro with 2 methods)

julia> @m "asd"
1 arguments

julia> @m 1 2
Two arguments
```
However one should keep in mind, that macro dispatch is based on the types of AST
that are handed to the macro, not the types that the AST evaluates to at runtime:
```jldoctest macromethods
julia> macro m(::Int)
           println("An Integer")
       end
@m (macro with 3 methods)

julia> @m 2
An Integer

julia> x = 2
2

julia> @m x
1 arguments
```

## Code Generation

When a significant amount of repetitive boilerplate code is required, it is common to generate
it programmatically to avoid redundancy. In most languages, this requires an extra build step,
and a separate program to generate the repetitive code. In Julia, expression interpolation and
[`eval`](@ref) allow such code generation to take place in the normal course of program execution.
For example, consider the following custom type

```jldoctest mynumber-codegen
struct MyNumber
    x::Float64
end
# output

```

for which we want to add a number of methods to. We can do this programmatically in the
following loop:

```jldoctest mynumber-codegen
for op = (:sin, :cos, :tan, :log, :exp)
    eval(quote
        Base.$op(a::MyNumber) = MyNumber($op(a.x))
    end)
end
# output

```

and we can now use those functions with our custom type:

```jldoctest mynumber-codegen
julia> x = MyNumber(π)
MyNumber(3.141592653589793)

julia> sin(x)
MyNumber(1.2246467991473532e-16)

julia> cos(x)
MyNumber(-1.0)
```

In this manner, Julia acts as its own [preprocessor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preprocessor),
and allows code generation from inside the language. The above code could be written slightly
more tersely using the `:` prefix quoting form:

```julia
for op = (:sin, :cos, :tan, :log, :exp)
    eval(:(Base.$op(a::MyNumber) = MyNumber($op(a.x))))
end
```

This sort of in-language code generation, however, using the `eval(quote(...))` pattern, is common
enough that Julia comes with a macro to abbreviate this pattern:

```julia
for op = (:sin, :cos, :tan, :log, :exp)
    @eval Base.$op(a::MyNumber) = MyNumber($op(a.x))
end
```

The [`@eval`](@ref) macro rewrites this call to be precisely equivalent to the above longer versions.
For longer blocks of generated code, the expression argument given to [`@eval`](@ref) can be a
block:

```julia
@eval begin
    # multiple lines
end
```

## Non-Standard String Literals

Recall from [Strings](@ref non-standard-string-literals) that string literals prefixed by an identifier are called non-standard
string literals, and can have different semantics than un-prefixed string literals. For example:

  * `r"^\s*(?:#|$)"` produces a regular expression object rather than a string
  * `b"DATA\xff\u2200"` is a byte array literal for `[68,65,84,65,255,226,136,128]`.

Perhaps surprisingly, these behaviors are not hard-coded into the Julia parser or compiler. Instead,
they are custom behaviors provided by a general mechanism that anyone can use: prefixed string
literals are parsed as calls to specially-named macros. For example, the regular expression macro
is just the following:

```julia
macro r_str(p)
    Regex(p)
end
```

That's all. This macro says that the literal contents of the string literal `r"^\s*(?:#|$)"` should
be passed to the `@r_str` macro and the result of that expansion should be placed in the syntax
tree where the string literal occurs. In other words, the expression `r"^\s*(?:#|$)"` is equivalent
to placing the following object directly into the syntax tree:

```julia
Regex("^\\s*(?:#|\$)")
```

Not only is the string literal form shorter and far more convenient, but it is also more efficient:
since the regular expression is compiled and the `Regex` object is actually created *when the code is compiled*,
the compilation occurs only once, rather than every time the code is executed. Consider if the
regular expression occurs in a loop:

```julia
for line = lines
    m = match(r"^\s*(?:#|$)", line)
    if m === nothing
        # non-comment
    else
        # comment
    end
end
```

Since the regular expression `r"^\s*(?:#|$)"` is compiled and inserted into the syntax tree when
this code is parsed, the expression is only compiled once instead of each time the loop is executed.
In order to accomplish this without macros, one would have to write this loop like this:

```julia
re = Regex("^\\s*(?:#|\$)")
for line = lines
    m = match(re, line)
    if m === nothing
        # non-comment
    else
        # comment
    end
end
```

Moreover, if the compiler could not determine that the regex object was constant over all loops,
certain optimizations might not be possible, making this version still less efficient than the
more convenient literal form above. Of course, there are still situations where the non-literal
form is more convenient: if one needs to interpolate a variable into the regular expression, one
must take this more verbose approach; in cases where the regular expression pattern itself is
dynamic, potentially changing upon each loop iteration, a new regular expression object must be
constructed on each iteration. In the vast majority of use cases, however, regular expressions
are not constructed based on run-time data. In this majority of cases, the ability to write regular
expressions as compile-time values is invaluable.

Like non-standard string literals, non-standard command literals exist using a prefixed variant
of the command literal syntax. The command literal ```custom`literal` ``` is parsed as `@custom_cmd "literal"`.
Julia itself does not contain any non-standard command literals, but packages can make use of
this syntax. Aside from the different syntax and the `_cmd` suffix instead of the `_str` suffix,
non-standard command literals behave exactly like non-standard string literals.

In the event that two modules provide non-standard string or command literals with the same name,
it is possible to qualify the string or command literal with a module name. For instance, if both
`Foo` and `Bar` provide non-standard string literal `@x_str`, then one can write `Foo.x"literal"`
or `Bar.x"literal"` to disambiguate between the two.

The mechanism for user-defined string literals is deeply, profoundly powerful. Not only are Julia's
non-standard literals implemented using it, but also the command literal syntax (``` `echo "Hello, $person"` ```)
is implemented with the following innocuous-looking macro:

```julia
macro cmd(str)
    :(cmd_gen($(shell_parse(str)[1])))
end
```

Of course, a large amount of complexity is hidden in the functions used in this macro definition,
but they are just functions, written entirely in Julia. You can read their source and see precisely
what they do -- and all they do is construct expression objects to be inserted into your program's
syntax tree.

## Generated functions

A very special macro is [`@generated`](@ref), which allows you to define so-called *generated functions*.
These have the capability to generate specialized code depending on the types of their arguments
with more flexibility and/or less code than what can be achieved with multiple dispatch. While
macros work with expressions at parse time and cannot access the types of their inputs, a generated
function gets expanded at a time when the types of the arguments are known, but the function is
not yet compiled.

Instead of performing some calculation or action, a generated function declaration returns a quoted
expression which then forms the body for the method corresponding to the types of the arguments.
When a generated function is called, the expression it returns is compiled and then run.
To make this efficient, the result is usually cached. And to make this inferable, only a limited
subset of the language is usable. Thus, generated functions provide a flexible way to move work from
run time to compile time, at the expense of greater restrictions on allowed constructs.

When defining generated functions, there are four main differences to ordinary functions:

1. You annotate the function declaration with the `@generated` macro. This adds some information
   to the AST that lets the compiler know that this is a generated function.
2. In the body of the generated function you only have access to the *types* of the arguments –
   not their values – and any function that was defined *before* the definition of the generated
   function.
3. Instead of calculating something or performing some action, you return a *quoted expression* which,
   when evaluated, does what you want.
4. Generated functions must not *mutate* or *observe* any non-constant global state (including,
   for example, IO, locks, non-local dictionaries, or using [`hasmethod`](@ref)).
   This means they can only read global constants, and cannot have any side effects.
   In other words, they must be completely pure.
   Due to an implementation limitation, this also means that they currently cannot define a closure
   or generator.

It's easiest to illustrate this with an example. We can declare a generated function `foo` as

```jldoctest generated
julia> @generated function foo(x)
           Core.println(x)
           return :(x * x)
       end
foo (generic function with 1 method)
```

Note that the body returns a quoted expression, namely `:(x * x)`, rather than just the value
of `x * x`.

From the caller's perspective, this is identical to a regular function; in fact, you don't
have to know whether you're calling a regular or generated function. Let's see how `foo` behaves:

```jldoctest generated
julia> x = foo(2); # note: output is from println() statement in the body
Int64

julia> x           # now we print x
4

julia> y = foo("bar");
String

julia> y
"barbar"
```

So, we see that in the body of the generated function, `x` is the *type* of the passed argument,
and the value returned by the generated function, is the result of evaluating the quoted expression
we returned from the definition, now with the *value* of `x`.

What happens if we evaluate `foo` again with a type that we have already used?

```jldoctest generated
julia> foo(4)
16
```

Note that there is no printout of [`Int64`](@ref). We can see that the body of the generated function
was only executed once here, for the specific set of argument types, and the result was cached.
After that, for this example, the expression returned from the generated function on the first
invocation was re-used as the method body. However, the actual caching behavior is an implementation-defined
performance optimization, so it is invalid to depend too closely on this behavior.

The number of times a generated function is generated *might* be only once, but it *might* also
be more often, or appear to not happen at all. As a consequence, you should *never* write a generated
function with side effects - when, and how often, the side effects occur is undefined. (This is
true for macros too - and just like for macros, the use of [`eval`](@ref) in a generated function
is a sign that you're doing something the wrong way.) However, unlike macros, the runtime system
cannot correctly handle a call to [`eval`](@ref), so it is disallowed.

It is also important to see how `@generated` functions interact with method redefinition.
Following the principle that a correct `@generated` function must not observe any
mutable state or cause any mutation of global state, we see the following behavior.
Observe that the generated function *cannot* call any method that was not defined
prior to the *definition* of the generated function itself.

Initially `f(x)` has one definition

```jldoctest redefinition
julia> f(x) = "original definition";
```

Define other operations that use `f(x)`:

```jldoctest redefinition
julia> g(x) = f(x);

julia> @generated gen1(x) = f(x);

julia> @generated gen2(x) = :(f(x));
```

We now add some new definitions for `f(x)`:

```jldoctest redefinition
julia> f(x::Int) = "definition for Int";

julia> f(x::Type{Int}) = "definition for Type{Int}";
```

and compare how these results differ:

```jldoctest redefinition
julia> f(1)
"definition for Int"

julia> g(1)
"definition for Int"

julia> gen1(1)
"original definition"

julia> gen2(1)
"definition for Int"
```

Each method of a generated function has its own view of defined functions:

```jldoctest redefinition
julia> @generated gen1(x::Real) = f(x);

julia> gen1(1)
"definition for Type{Int}"
```

The example generated function `foo` above did not do anything a normal function `foo(x) = x * x`
could not do (except printing the type on the first invocation, and incurring higher overhead).
However, the power of a generated function lies in its ability to compute different quoted expressions
depending on the types passed to it:

```jldoctest
julia> @generated function bar(x)
           if x <: Integer
               return :(x ^ 2)
           else
               return :(x)
           end
       end
bar (generic function with 1 method)

julia> bar(4)
16

julia> bar("baz")
"baz"
```

(although of course this contrived example would be more easily implemented using multiple dispatch...)

Abusing this will corrupt the runtime system and cause undefined behavior:

```jldoctest
julia> @generated function baz(x)
           if rand() < .9
               return :(x^2)
           else
               return :("boo!")
           end
       end
baz (generic function with 1 method)
```

Since the body of the generated function is non-deterministic, its behavior, *and the behavior of all subsequent code*
is undefined.

*Don't copy these examples!*

These examples are hopefully helpful to illustrate how generated functions work, both in the definition
end and at the call site; however, *don't copy them*, for the following reasons:

  * the `foo` function has side-effects (the call to `Core.println`), and it is undefined exactly
    when, how often or how many times these side-effects will occur
  * the `bar` function solves a problem that is better solved with multiple dispatch - defining `bar(x) = x`
    and `bar(x::Integer) = x ^ 2` will do the same thing, but it is both simpler and faster.
  * the `baz` function is pathological

Note that the set of operations that should not be attempted in a generated function is unbounded,
and the runtime system can currently only detect a subset of the invalid operations. There are
many other operations that will simply corrupt the runtime system without notification, usually
in subtle ways not obviously connected to the bad definition. Because the function generator is
run during inference, it must respect all of the limitations of that code.

Some operations that should not be attempted include:

1. Caching of native pointers.
2. Interacting with the contents or methods of `Core.Compiler` in any way.
3. Observing any mutable state.

     * Inference on the generated function may be run at *any* time, including while your code is attempting
       to observe or mutate this state.
4. Taking any locks: C code you call out to may use locks internally, (for example, it is not problematic
   to call `malloc`, even though most implementations require locks internally) but don't attempt
   to hold or acquire any while executing Julia code.
5. Calling any function that is defined after the body of the generated function. This condition
   is relaxed for incrementally-loaded precompiled modules to allow calling any function in the module.

Alright, now that we have a better understanding of how generated functions work, let's use them
to build some more advanced (and valid) functionality...

### An advanced example

Julia's base library has a an internal `sub2ind` function to calculate a linear index into an n-dimensional
array, based on a set of n multilinear indices - in other words, to calculate the index `i` that
can be used to index into an array `A` using `A[i]`, instead of `A[x,y,z,...]`. One possible implementation
is the following:

```jldoctest sub2ind
julia> function sub2ind_loop(dims::NTuple{N}, I::Integer...) where N
           ind = I[N] - 1
           for i = N-1:-1:1
               ind = I[i]-1 + dims[i]*ind
           end
           return ind + 1
       end
sub2ind_loop (generic function with 1 method)

julia> sub2ind_loop((3, 5), 1, 2)
4
```

The same thing can be done using recursion:

```jldoctest
julia> sub2ind_rec(dims::Tuple{}) = 1;

julia> sub2ind_rec(dims::Tuple{}, i1::Integer, I::Integer...) =
           i1 == 1 ? sub2ind_rec(dims, I...) : throw(BoundsError());

julia> sub2ind_rec(dims::Tuple{Integer, Vararg{Integer}}, i1::Integer) = i1;

julia> sub2ind_rec(dims::Tuple{Integer, Vararg{Integer}}, i1::Integer, I::Integer...) =
           i1 + dims[1] * (sub2ind_rec(Base.tail(dims), I...) - 1);

julia> sub2ind_rec((3, 5), 1, 2)
4
```

Both these implementations, although different, do essentially the same thing: a runtime loop
over the dimensions of the array, collecting the offset in each dimension into the final index.

However, all the information we need for the loop is embedded in the type information of the arguments.
Thus, we can utilize generated functions to move the iteration to compile-time; in compiler parlance,
we use generated functions to manually unroll the loop. The body becomes almost identical, but
instead of calculating the linear index, we build up an *expression* that calculates the index:

```jldoctest sub2ind_gen
julia> @generated function sub2ind_gen(dims::NTuple{N}, I::Integer...) where N
           ex = :(I[$N] - 1)
           for i = (N - 1):-1:1
               ex = :(I[$i] - 1 + dims[$i] * $ex)
           end
           return :($ex + 1)
       end
sub2ind_gen (generic function with 1 method)

julia> sub2ind_gen((3, 5), 1, 2)
4
```

**What code will this generate?**

An easy way to find out is to extract the body into another (regular) function:

```jldoctest sub2ind_gen2
julia> @generated function sub2ind_gen(dims::NTuple{N}, I::Integer...) where N
           return sub2ind_gen_impl(dims, I...)
       end
sub2ind_gen (generic function with 1 method)

julia> function sub2ind_gen_impl(dims::Type{T}, I...) where T <: NTuple{N,Any} where N
           length(I) == N || return :(error("partial indexing is unsupported"))
           ex = :(I[$N] - 1)
           for i = (N - 1):-1:1
               ex = :(I[$i] - 1 + dims[$i] * $ex)
           end
           return :($ex + 1)
       end
sub2ind_gen_impl (generic function with 1 method)
```

We can now execute `sub2ind_gen_impl` and examine the expression it returns:

```jldoctest sub2ind_gen2
julia> sub2ind_gen_impl(Tuple{Int,Int}, Int, Int)
:(((I[1] - 1) + dims[1] * (I[2] - 1)) + 1)
```

So, the method body that will be used here doesn't include a loop at all - just indexing into
the two tuples, multiplication and addition/subtraction. All the looping is performed compile-time,
and we avoid looping during execution entirely. Thus, we only loop *once per type*, in this case
once per `N` (except in edge cases where the function is generated more than once - see disclaimer
above).

### Optionally-generated functions

Generated functions can achieve high efficiency at run time, but come with a compile time cost:
a new function body must be generated for every combination of concrete argument types.
Typically, Julia is able to compile "generic" versions of functions that will work for any
arguments, but with generated functions this is impossible.
This means that programs making heavy use of generated functions might be impossible to
statically compile.

To solve this problem, the language provides syntax for writing normal, non-generated
alternative implementations of generated functions.
Applied to the `sub2ind` example above, it would look like this:

```julia
function sub2ind_gen(dims::NTuple{N}, I::Integer...) where N
    if N != length(I)
        throw(ArgumentError("Number of dimensions must match number of indices."))
    end
    if @generated
        ex = :(I[$N] - 1)
        for i = (N - 1):-1:1
            ex = :(I[$i] - 1 + dims[$i] * $ex)
        end
        return :($ex + 1)
    else
        ind = I[N] - 1
        for i = (N - 1):-1:1
            ind = I[i] - 1 + dims[i]*ind
        end
        return ind + 1
    end
end
```

Internally, this code creates two implementations of the function: a generated one where
the first block in `if @generated` is used, and a normal one where the `else` block is used.
Inside the `then` part of the `if @generated` block, code has the same semantics as other
generated functions: argument names refer to types, and the code should return an expression.
Multiple `if @generated` blocks may occur, in which case the generated implementation uses
all of the `then` blocks and the alternate implementation uses all of the `else` blocks.

Notice that we added an error check to the top of the function.
This code will be common to both versions, and is run-time code in both versions
(it will be quoted and returned as an expression from the generated version).
That means that the values and types of local variables are not available at code generation
time --- the code-generation code can only see the types of arguments.

In this style of definition, the code generation feature is essentially an optional
optimization.
The compiler will use it if convenient, but otherwise may choose to use the normal
implementation instead.
This style is preferred, since it allows the compiler to make more decisions and compile
programs in more ways, and since normal code is more readable than code-generating code.
However, which implementation is used depends on compiler implementation details, so it
is essential for the two implementations to behave identically.
