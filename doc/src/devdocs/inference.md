# Inference

## How inference works

[Type inference](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_inference) refers
to the process of deducing the types of later values from the types of
input values. Julia's approach to inference has been described in blog
posts
([1](https://juliacomputing.com/blog/2016/04/inference-convergence/),
[2](https://juliacomputing.com/blog/2017/05/inference-converage2/)).

## Debugging compiler.jl

You can start a Julia session, edit `compiler/*.jl` (for example to
insert `print` statements), and then replace `Core.Compiler` in your
running session by navigating to `base` and executing
`include("compiler/compiler.jl")`. This trick typically leads to much faster
development than if you rebuild Julia for each change.

Alternatively, you can use the [Revise.jl](https://github.com/timholy/Revise.jl)
package to track the compiler changes by using the command
`Revise.track(Core.Compiler)` at the beginning of your Julia session. As
explained in the [Revise documentation](https://timholy.github.io/Revise.jl/stable/),
the modifications to the compiler will be reflected when the modified files
are saved.

A convenient entry point into inference is `typeinf_code`. Here's a
demo running inference on `convert(Int, UInt(1))`:

```julia
# Get the method
atypes = Tuple{Type{Int}, UInt}  # argument types
mths = methods(convert, atypes)  # worth checking that there is only one
m = first(mths)

# Create variables needed to call `typeinf_code`
interp = Core.Compiler.NativeInterpreter()
sparams = Core.svec()      # this particular method doesn't have type-parameters
optimize = true            # run all inference optimizations
types = Tuple{typeof(convert), atypes.parameters...} # Tuple{typeof(convert), Type{Int}, UInt}
Core.Compiler.typeinf_code(interp, m, types, sparams, optimize)
```

If your debugging adventures require a `MethodInstance`, you can look it up by
calling `Core.Compiler.specialize_method` using many of the variables above.
A `CodeInfo` object may be obtained with
```julia
# Returns the CodeInfo object for `convert(Int, ::UInt)`:
ci = (@code_typed convert(Int, UInt(1)))[1]
```

## The inlining algorithm (`inline_worthy`)

Much of the hardest work for inlining runs in `ssa_inlining_pass!`.
However, if your question is "why didn't my function inline?"
then you will most likely be interested in `inline_worthy`,
which makes a decision to inline the function call or not.

`inline_worthy` implements a cost-model, where "cheap" functions get
inlined; more specifically, we inline functions if their anticipated
run-time is not large compared to the time it would take to
[issue a call](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calling_convention) to
them if they were not inlined. The cost-model is extremely simple and
ignores many important details: for example, all `for` loops are
analyzed as if they will be executed once, and the cost of an
`if...else...end` includes the summed cost of all branches. It's also
worth acknowledging that we currently lack a suite of functions
suitable for testing how well the cost model predicts the actual
run-time cost, although
[BaseBenchmarks](https://github.com/JuliaCI/BaseBenchmarks.jl)
provides a great deal of indirect information about the successes and
failures of any modification to the inlining algorithm.

The foundation of the cost-model is a lookup table, implemented in
`add_tfunc` and its callers, that assigns an estimated cost (measured
in CPU cycles) to each of Julia's intrinsic functions. These costs are
based on
[standard ranges for common architectures](http://ithare.com/wp-content/uploads/part101_infographics_v08.png)
(see
[Agner Fog's analysis](https://www.agner.org/optimize/instruction_tables.pdf)
for more detail).

We supplement this low-level lookup table with a number of special
cases. For example, an `:invoke` expression (a call for which all
input and output types were inferred in advance) is assigned a fixed
cost (currently 20 cycles). In contrast, a `:call` expression, for
functions other than intrinsics/builtins, indicates that the call will
require dynamic dispatch, in which case we assign a cost set by
`Params.inline_nonleaf_penalty` (currently set at `1000`). Note
that this is not a "first-principles" estimate of the raw cost of
dynamic dispatch, but a mere heuristic indicating that dynamic
dispatch is extremely expensive.

Each statement gets analyzed for its total cost in a function called
`statement_cost`. You can display the cost associated with each statement
as follows:
```jldoctest; filter=r"tuple.jl:\d+"
julia> Base.print_statement_costs(stdout, map, (typeof(sqrt), Tuple{Int},)) # map(sqrt, (2,))
map(f, t::Tuple{Any}) @ Base tuple.jl:273
  0 1 ─ %1  = Base.getfield(_3, 1, true)::Int64
  1 │   %2  = Base.sitofp(Float64, %1)::Float64
  2 │   %3  = Base.lt_float(%2, 0.0)::Bool
  0 └──       goto #3 if not %3
  0 2 ─       invoke Base.Math.throw_complex_domainerror(:sqrt::Symbol, %2::Float64)::Union{}
  0 └──       unreachable
 20 3 ─ %7  = Base.Math.sqrt_llvm(%2)::Float64
  0 └──       goto #4
  0 4 ─       goto #5
  0 5 ─ %10 = Core.tuple(%7)::Tuple{Float64}
  0 └──       return %10
```

The line costs are in the left column. This includes the consequences of inlining and other forms of optimization.
