## [Low-level synchronization using `schedule` and `wait`](@id low-level-schedule-wait)

The easiest correct use of [`schedule`](@ref) is on a `Task` that is not started (scheduled)
yet.  However, it is possible to use [`schedule`](@ref) and [`wait`](@ref) as a very
low-level building block for constructing synchronization interfaces.  A crucial
pre-condition of calling `schedule(task)` is that the caller must "own" the `task`; i.e., it
must know that the call to `wait` in the given `task` is happening at the locations known to
the code calling `schedule(task)`.  One strategy for ensuring such pre-condition is to use
atomics, as demonstrated in the following example:

```jldoctest
@enum OWEState begin
    OWE_EMPTY
    OWE_WAITING
    OWE_NOTIFYING
end

mutable struct OneWayEvent
    @atomic state::OWEState
    task::Task
    OneWayEvent() = new(OWE_EMPTY)
end

function Base.notify(ev::OneWayEvent)
    state = @atomic ev.state
    while state !== OWE_NOTIFYING
        # Spin until we successfully update the state to OWE_NOTIFYING:
        state, ok = @atomicreplace(ev.state, state => OWE_NOTIFYING)
        if ok
            if state == OWE_WAITING
                # OWE_WAITING -> OWE_NOTIFYING transition means that the waiter task is
                # already waiting or about to call `wait`. The notifier task must wake up
                # the waiter task.
                schedule(ev.task)
            else
                @assert state == OWE_EMPTY
                # Since we are assuming that there is only one notifier task (for
                # simplicity), we know that the other possible case here is OWE_EMPTY.
                # We do not need to do anything because we know that the waiter task has
                # not called `wait(ev::OneWayEvent)` yet.
            end
            break
        end
    end
    return
end

function Base.wait(ev::OneWayEvent)
    ev.task = current_task()
    state, ok = @atomicreplace(ev.state, OWE_EMPTY => OWE_WAITING)
    if ok
        # OWE_EMPTY -> OWE_WAITING transition means that the notifier task is guaranteed to
        # invoke OWE_WAITING -> OWE_NOTIFYING transition.  The waiter task must call
        # `wait()` immediately.  In particular, it MUST NOT invoke any function that may
        # yield to the scheduler at this point in code.
        wait()
    else
        @assert state == OWE_NOTIFYING
        # Otherwise, the `state` must have already been moved to OWE_NOTIFYING by the
        # notifier task.
    end
    return
end

ev = OneWayEvent()
@sync begin
    @async begin
        wait(ev)
        println("done")
    end
    println("notifying...")
    notify(ev)
end

# output
notifying...
done
```

`OneWayEvent` lets one task to `wait` for another task's `notify`.  It is a limited
communication interface since `wait` can only be used once from a single task (note the
non-atomic assignment of `ev.task`)

In this example, `notify(ev::OneWayEvent)` is allowed to call `schedule(ev.task)` if and
only if *it* modifies the state from `OWE_WAITING` to `OWE_NOTIFYING`.  This lets us know that
the task executing `wait(ev::OneWayEvent)` is now in the `ok` branch and that there cannot be
other tasks that tries to `schedule(ev.task)` since their
`@atomicreplace(ev.state, state => OWE_NOTIFYING)` will fail.
