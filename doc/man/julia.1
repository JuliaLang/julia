.SH NAME
julia, julia-basic, julia-readline - high-level, high-performance dynamic programming language for technical computing

.SH SYNOPSIS
julia [option] [program] [args..]

.\" Taken almost verbatim from the front page of http://julialang.org/
.SH DESCRIPTION
Julia is a high-level, high-performance dynamic programming language
for technical computing, with syntax that is familiar to users
of other technical computing environments.
It provides a sophisticated compiler, distributed parallel execution,
numerical accuracy, and an extensive mathematical function library.
The library, largely written in Julia itself, also integrates mature,
best-of-breed C and Fortran libraries for linear algebra,
random number generation, signal processing, and string processing.
In addition, the Julia developer community is contributing a number of
external packages through Julia's built-in package manager at a rapid pace.
Julia programs are organized around multiple dispatch;
by defining functions and overloading them for different combinations
of argument types, which can also be user-defined.
For a more in-depth discussion of the rationale and advantages of Julia
over other systems, please see the online manual:
http://docs.julialang.org/en/latest/manual/

\fBjulia\fP is an alias for \fBjulia-readline\fP.

\fBjulia-readline\fP launches an interactive Julia session with Readline
capabilities.

\fBjulia-basic\fP launches an interactive Julia session without
Readline capabilities.

If a Julia source file is given as \fIprogram\fP (possibly with arguments in
\fIargs\fP) then, instead of launching an interactive session, Julia executes
the program and exits.
