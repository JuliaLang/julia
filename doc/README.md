# Julia Documentation README

Julia's documentation is written in Markdown. A reference of all supported syntax can be found in the [manual](https://docs.julialang.org/en/latest/manual/documentation/#Markdown-syntax-1). All documentation can be found in the Markdown files in `doc/src/` and the docstrings in Julia source files in `base/`.

## Requirements

This documentation is built using the [Documenter.jl](https://github.com/JuliaDocs/Documenter.jl) package.

All dependencies are automatically installed into a sandboxed package directory in `doc/deps/` to avoid interfering with user-installed packages.

## Building

To build Julia's documentation run

```sh
$ make docs
```

from the root directory. This will build the HTML documentation and output it to the `doc/_build/` folder.

## Testing

To run the doctests found in the manual run

```sh
$ make -C doc doctest=true
```

from the root directory.
