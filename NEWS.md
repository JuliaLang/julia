Julia v1.4 Release Notes
========================

New language features
---------------------

* Structs with all isbits and isbitsunion fields are now stored inline in arrays ([#32448]).

* `import` now allows quoted symbols, e.g. `import Base.:+` ([#33158]).

Language changes
----------------


Multi-threading changes
-----------------------


Build system changes
--------------------


New library functions
---------------------

* The `splitpath` function now accepts any `AbstractString` whereas previously it only accepted paths of type `String` ([#33012]).
* The `tempname` function now takes an optional `parent::AbstractString` argument to give it a directory in which to attempt to produce a temporary path name ([#33090]).
* The `tempname` function now takes a `cleanup::Bool` keyword argument defaulting to `true`, which causes the process to try to ensure that any file or directory at the path returned by `tempname` is deleted upon process exit ([#33090]).
* The `readdir` function now takes a `join::Bool` keyword argument defaulting to `false`, which when set causes `readdir` to join its directory argument with each listed name ([#33113]).


Standard library changes
------------------------

* The methods of `mktemp` and `mktempdir` which take a function body to pass temporary paths to no longer throw errors if the path is already deleted when the function body returns ([#33091]).

#### Libdl


#### LinearAlgebra

* `qr` and `qr!` functions support `blocksize` keyword argument ([#33053]).

* `dot` now admits a 3-argument method `dot(x, A, y)` to compute generalized dot products `dot(x, A*y)`, but without computing and storing the intermediate result `A*y` ([#32739]).

#### SparseArrays


#### Dates


#### Statistics


#### Sockets

#### Random

* The default sampler for floats had a small bias ([#33222]), which is now fixed ([#33251]), and the default random sampler for floats now generates interior values in `(0, 1)`. The previous default sampler is available as `Random.CloseOpen01`.
