Julia v1.5 Release Notes
========================

New language features
---------------------


Language changes
----------------

* Converting arbitrary tuples to `NTuple`, e.g. `convert(NTuple, (1, ""))` now gives an error,
  where it used to be incorrectly allowed. This is because `NTuple` refers only to homogeneous
  tuples (this meaning has not changed) ([#34272]).

* In docstrings, a level-1 markdown header "Extended help" is now
  interpreted as a marker dividing "brief help" from "extended help."
  The REPL help mode only shows the brief help (the content before the
  "Extended help" header) by default; prepend the expression with '?'
  (in addition to the one that enters the help mode) to see the full
  docstring. ([#25903])


Multi-threading changes
-----------------------


Build system changes
--------------------


New library functions
---------------------


New library features
--------------------
* Function composition now works also on one argument `âˆ˜(f) = f` (#34251)


Standard library changes
------------------------
* The `@timed` macro now returns a `NamedTuple` ([#34149])

#### LinearAlgebra
* The BLAS submodule now supports the level-2 BLAS subroutine `hpmv!` ([#34211]).
* `normalize` now supports multidimensional arrays ([#34239])
* `lq` factorizations can now be used to compute the minimum-norm solution to under-determined systems ([#34350]).
