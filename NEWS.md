Julia v1.13 Release Notes
========================

New language features
---------------------

  - New `Base.@acquire` macro for a non-closure version of `Base.acquire(f, s::Base.Semaphore)`, like `@lock`. ([#56845])

Language changes
----------------

Compiler/Runtime improvements
-----------------------------

Command-line option changes
---------------------------

Multi-threading changes
-----------------------

Build system changes
--------------------

New library functions
---------------------

* a new abstract type for iterators with `HasShape{N}` is added: `ShapefulIterator{N}`. It supertypes existing abstract types:
    * `AbstractArray`
    * `AbstractChar`
    * `Number`
    * `Ref`
  It's still acceptable to define a new shapeful iterator type that does not subtype `ShapefulIterator`, however choosing to subtype `ShapefulIterator{N}` means there's no need to add certain methods for one's newly-defined type.

New library features
--------------------

* `sort(keys(::Dict))` and `sort(values(::Dict))` now automatically collect, they previously threw ([#56978]).
* `Base.AbstractOneTo` is added as a supertype of one-based axes, with `Base.OneTo` as its subtype ([#56902]).

Standard library changes

#### Profile

#### REPL

* Test failures when using the `@test` macro now show evaluated arguments for all function calls ([#57825], [#57839]).
