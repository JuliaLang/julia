Julia v0.5.0 Release Notes
==========================

New language features
---------------------

  * `x âˆˆ X` is now a synonym for `x in X` in `for` loops and comprehensions,
    as it already was in comparisons ([#13824]).

Language changes
----------------

  * `using` and `import` are now case-sensitive even on case-insensitive filesystems (common on Mac and Windows) ([#13542]).

  * Relational symbols are now allowed as infix operators ([#8036]).

Command-line option changes
---------------------------

Compiler/Runtime improvements
-----------------------------

Library improvements
--------------------

  * Most of the  combinatorics functions have been moved from `Base`
    to the [Combinatorics.jl package](https://github.com/JuliaLang/Combinatorics.jl) ([#13897]).

  * Packages:

    * The package system (`Pkg`) is now based on the `libgit2` library, rather
      than running the `git` program, increasing performance (especially on
      Windows) ([#11196]).

    * Package-development functions like `Pkg.tag` and `Pkg.publish`
      have been moved to an external [PkgDev] package ([#13387]).

  * The `Base.Test` module now has a `@testset` feature to bundle
    tests together and delay throwing an error until the end ([#13062]).

    * The new features are mirrored in the
      [BaseTestNext](https://github.com/IainNZ/BaseTestNext.jl)
      package for users who would like to use the new functionality on Julia v0.4.

    * The [BaseTestDeprecated](https://github.com/IainNZ/BaseTestDeprecated.jl)
      package provides the old-style `handler` functionality, for compatibility
      with code that needs to support both Julia v0.4 and v0.5.

  * The functions `remotecall`, `remotecall_fetch`, and `remotecall_wait` now have the
    function argument as the first argument to allow for do-block syntax ([#13338]).

  * `cov` and `cor` don't use keyword arguments anymore and are therefore now type stable ([#13465]).

  * Linear algebra:

    * All dimensions indexed by scalars are now dropped, whereas previously only
      trailing scalar dimensions would be omitted from the result.

    * New `normalize` and `normalize!` convenience functions for normalizing
      vectors ([#13681]).

    * QR

      * New method for generic QR with column pivoting ([#13480]).

      * New method for polar decompositions of `AbstractVector`s ([#13681]).

    * A new `SparseVector` type allows for one-dimensional sparse arrays.
      Slicing and reshaping sparse matrices now return vectors when
      appropriate. The `sparsevec` function returns a one-dimensional sparse
      vector instead of a one-column sparse matrix. ([#13440])

  * New `foreach` function for calling a function on every element of a collection when
    the results are not needed.

  * `Cmd(cmd; ...)` now accepts new Windows-specific options `windows_verbatim`
    (to alter Windows command-line generation) and `windows_hide` (to
    suppress creation of new console windows) ([#13780]).

Deprecated or removed
---------------------

  * The following function names have been simplified and unified ([#13232]):

    * `get_bigfloat_precision`  -> `precision(BigFloat)`
    * `set_bigfloat_precision`  -> `setprecision`
    * `with_bigfloat_precision` -> `setprecision`

    * `get_rounding`            -> `rounding`
    * `set_rounding`            -> `setrounding`
    * `with_rounding`           -> `setrounding`

  * The method `A_ldiv_B!(SparseMatrixCSC, StrideVecOrMat)` has been deprecated
    in favor of versions that require the matrix to be in factored form
    ([#13496]).

  * Deprecate `chol(A,Val{:U/:L})` in favor of `chol(A)` ([#13680]).

Julia v0.4.0 Release Notes
==========================

New language features
---------------------

  * Function call overloading: for arbitrary objects `x` (not of type
    `Function`), `x(...)` is transformed into `call(x, ...)`, and `call`
    can be overloaded as desired.  Constructors are now a special case of
    this mechanism, which allows e.g. constructors for abstract types.
    `T(...)` falls back to `convert(T, x)`, so all `convert` methods implicitly
    define a constructor ([#8712], [#2403]).

  * Unicode version 8 is now supported for identifiers etcetera ([#7917], [#12031]).

  * Type parameters now permit any `isbits` type, not just `Int` and `Bool` ([#6081]).

  * Keyword argument names can be computed, using syntax such as `f(; symbol => val)` ([#7704]).

  * The syntax `@generated function` enables generation of specialized methods based on
    argument types. At compile time, the function is called with its arguments bound to their
    types instead of to their values. The function then returns an expression forming the
    body of the function to be called at run time ([#7311]).

  * [Documentation system](http://docs.julialang.org/en/latest/manual/documentation/)
    for functions, methods, types and macros in packages and user code ([#8791]).

  * The syntax `function foo end` can be used to introduce a generic function without
    yet adding any methods ([#8283]).

  * Incremental precompilation of modules: call `VERSION >= v"0.4.0-dev+6521" && __precompile__()` at the top of a
    module file to automatically precompile it when it is imported ([#12491]), or manually
    run `Base.compilecache(modulename)`. The resulting precompiled `.ji` file is saved in
    `~/.julia/lib/v0.4` ([#8745]).

      * See manual section on `Module initialization and precompilation` (under `Modules`) for
        details and errata.  In particular, to be safely precompilable a module may need an
        `__init__` function to separate code that must be executed at runtime rather than precompile
        time.  Modules that are *not* precompilable should call `__precompile__(false)`.

      * The precompiled `.ji` file includes a list of dependencies (modules and files that
        were imported/included at precompile-time), and the module is automatically recompiled
        upon `import` when any of its dependencies have changed.  Explicit dependencies
        on other files can be declared with `include_dependency(path)` ([#12458]).

      * New option `--output-incremental={yes|no}` added to invoke the equivalent of `Base.compilecache`
        from the command line.

  * The syntax `new{parameters...}(...)` can be used in constructors to specify parameters for
    the type to be constructed ([#8135]).

  * `++` is now parsed as an infix operator, but does not yet have a default definition ([#11030], [#11686]).

  * Support for inter-task communication using `Channels` ([#12264]).
    See http://docs.julialang.org/en/latest/manual/parallel-computing/#channels for details.

  * `RemoteRef`s now point to remote channels. The remote channels can be of length greater than 1.
    Default continues to be of length 1 ([#12385]).
    See http://docs.julialang.org/en/latest/manual/parallel-computing/#remoterefs-and-abstractchannels for details.

  * `@__LINE__` special macro now available to reflect invocation source line number ([#12727]).

Language changes
----------------

  * Tuple types are now written as `Tuple{A, B}` instead of as `(A, B)`.
    Tuples of bits types are inlined into structs and arrays, like other
    immutable types.
    `...` now does splatting inside parentheses, instead of constructing a
    variadic tuple type ([#10380]).
    Variadic tuple types are written as `Tuple{Vararg{T}}`.

  * Using `[x,y]` to concatenate arrays is deprecated, and in the future will
    construct a vector of `x` and `y` instead ([#3737], [#2488], [#8599]).

  * Significant improvements to `ccall` and `cfunction`

    * As a safer alternative to creating pointers (`Ptr`), the managed reference type
      `Ref` has been added. A `Ref` points to the data contained by a value in an
      abstract sense, and in a way that is GC-safe. For example, `Ref(2)` points to
      a storage location that contains the integer `2`, and `Ref(array,3)` points
      to the third element of an array. A `Ref` can be automatically converted to a
      native pointer when passed to a `ccall`.

    * When passing a by-reference argument to `ccall`, you can declare
      the argument type to be `Ref{T}` instead of `Ptr{T}`, and just
      pass `x` instead of `&x`.

    * `ccall` is now lowered to call `unsafe_convert(T, cconvert(T, x))` on each
      argument. `cconvert` falls back to `convert`, but can be used to convert an
      argument to an arbitrarily-different representation more suitable for passing
      to C. `unsafe_convert` then handles conversions to `Ptr`.

    * `ccall` and `cfunction` now support correctly passing and returning structs,
      following the platform ABI (assuming the C types are mirrored accurately in Julia).

    * `cfunction` arguments of struct-like Julia types are now passed by value.
      If `Ref{T}` is used as a `cfunction` argument type, it will look up the
      method applicable to `T`, but pass the argument by reference (as Julia functions
      usually do). However, this should only be used for objects allocated by Julia
      and for `isbits` types.

  * `convert(Ptr,x)` is deprecated for most types, replaced by
    `unsafe_convert`. You can still `convert` between pointer types,
    and between pointers and `Int` or `UInt`.

  * Module `__init__` methods no longer swallow thrown exceptions; they now
    throw an `InitError` wrapping the thrown exception ([#12576]).

  * Unsigned `BigInt` literal syntax has been removed ([#11105]).
    Unsigned literals larger than `UInt128` now throw a syntax error.

  * `error(::Exception)` and `error(::Type{Exception})` have been deprecated
     in favor of using an explicit `throw` ([#9690]).

  * `Uint` etcetera are renamed to `UInt` ([#8905]).

  * `String` is renamed to `AbstractString` ([#8872]).

  * `FloatingPoint` is renamed to `AbstractFloat` ([#12162]).

  * `None` is deprecated; use `Union{}` instead ([#8423]).

  * `Nothing` (the type of `nothing`) is renamed to `Void` ([#8423]).

  * Arrays can be constructed with the syntax `Array{T}(m,n)` ([#3214], [#10075]).

  * `Dict` literal syntax `[a=>b,c=>d]` is replaced by `Dict(a=>b,c=>d)`,
    `{a=>b}` is replaced by `Dict{Any,Any}(a=>b)`, and
    `(K=>V)[...]` is replaced by `Dict{K,V}(...)`.
    The new syntax has many advantages: all of its components are first-class,
    it generalizes to other types of containers, it is easier to guess how to
    specify key and value types, and the syntaxes for empty and pre-populated
    dicts are synchronized. As part of this change, `=>` is parsed as a normal
    operator, and `Base` defines it to construct `Pair` objects ([#6739]).

  * `Char` is no longer a subtype of `Integer` ([#8816]).
    Char now supports a more limited set of operations with `Integer` types:

      * comparison / equality
      * `Char` + `Int` = `Char`
      * `Char` - `Char` = `Int`

  * `round` rounds to the nearest integer using the default rounding mode,
    which is ties-to-even by default ([#8750]).

  * A custom triple-quoted string like `x"""..."""` no longer invokes an `x_mstr`
    macro. Instead, the string is first unindented and then `x_str` is invoked,
    as if the string had been single-quoted ([#10228]).

  * Colons (`:`) within indexing expressions are no longer lowered to the range
    `1:end`. Instead, the `:` identifier is passed directly. Custom array types
    that implement `getindex` or `setindex!` methods must also extend those
    methods to support arguments of type `Colon` ([#10331]).

  * Unions of types should now be written with curly braces instead of parentheses, i.e.
    `Union{Type1, Type2}` instead of `Union(Type1, Type2)` ([#11432]).

  * The keyword `local` is no longer allowed in global scope. Use `let` instead of
    `begin` to create a new scope from the top level ([#7234], [#10472]).

  * Triple-quoted strings no longer treat tabs as 8 spaces. Instead, the
    longest common prefix of spaces and tabs is removed.

  * `global x` in a nested scope is now a syntax error if `x` is local
    to the enclosing scope ([#7264]/[#11985]).

  * The default `importall Base.Operators` is deprecated, and relying on it
    will give a warning ([#8113]).

  * `remotecall_fetch` and `fetch` now rethrow any uncaught remote exception locally as a
    `RemoteException`. Previously they would return the remote exception object.
    The worker pid, remote exception and remote backtrace are available in the
    thrown `RemoteException`.

  * If any of the enclosed async operations in a `@sync` block throw exceptions, they
    are now collected in a `CompositeException` and the `CompositeException` thrown.


Command line option changes
---------------------------

  * The `-i` option now forces the REPL to run after loading the specified script (if any) ([#11347]).

  * New option `--handle-signals={yes|no}` to disable Julia's signal handlers.

  * The `--depwarn={yes|no|error}` option enables/disables syntax and method deprecation warnings,
    or turns them into errors ([#9294]).

  * Some command line options are slated for deprecation / removal
    - `-f, --no-startup` Don't load ~/.juliarc (deprecated, use --startup-file=no)
    - `-F` Load ~/.juliarc (deprecated, use --startup-file=yes)`
    - `-P, --post-boot <expr>`  Evaluate <expr>, but don't disable interactive mode (deprecated, use -i -e instead)
    - `--no-history-file`  Don't load history file (deprecated, use --history-file=no)

Compiler/Runtime improvements
-----------------------------

  * Functions may be annotated with metadata (`:meta` expressions) to be used by the compiler ([#8297]).

  * `@inline` before a function definition forces the compiler to inline the function ([#8297]).

  * Loads from heap-allocated immutables are hoisted out of loops in more cases ([#8867]).

  * Accessing fields that are always initialized no longer produces undefined checks ([#8827]).

  * New generational garbage collector which greatly reduces GC overhead for many commmon workloads ([#5227]).

Library improvements
--------------------

  * Build with USE_GPL_LIBS=0 to exclude all GPL libraries and code ([#10870]).

  * Linear algebra

    * The `LinAlg` module is now exported.

    * `sparse(A)` now takes any `AbstractMatrix` A as an argument ([#10031]).

    * Factorization API is now type-stable; functions dispatch on `Val{false}` or `Val{true}` instead of a boolean value ([#9575]).

    * Added generic Cholesky factorization, and the Cholesky factorization is now parametrized by the matrix type ([#7236]).

    * Sparse `cholfact` and `ldltfact` functions now accept a `perm` keyword
      for user-provided permutations and a `shift` keyword to factorize
      a shifted matrix ([#10844]).

    * New `svds` function for the sparse truncated SVD ([#9425]).

    * `Symmetric` and `Hermitian` immutables are now parametrized by the matrix type ([#7992]).

    * New `ordschur` and `ordschur!` functions for sorting a Schur factorization by the eigenvalues ([#8467],[#9701]).

    * `Givens` type doesn't have a size anymore and is no longer a subtype of `AbstractMatrix` ([#8660]).

    * Large speedup in sparse `\` and splitting of Cholesky and LDLáµ€ factorizations into `cholfact` and `ldltfact` ([#10117]).

    * Add sparse least squares to `\` by adding `qrfact` for sparse matrices based on the SPQR library ([#10180]).

    * Split `Triangular` type into `UpperTriangular`, `LowerTriangular`, `UnitUpperTriagular` and `UnitLowerTriangular` ([#9779])

    * OpenBLAS 64-bit (ILP64) interface is now compiled with a `64_` suffix ([#8734]) to avoid conflicts with external libraries using a 32-bit BLAS ([#4923]).

    * New `vecdot` function, analogous to `vecnorm`, for Euclidean inner products over any iterable container ([#11067]).

    * `p = plan_fft(x)` and similar functions now return a `Base.DFT.Plan` object, rather
    than an anonymous function.  Calling it via `p(x)` is deprecated in favor of
    `p * x` or `p \ x` (for the inverse), and it can also be used with `A_mul_B!`
    to employ pre-allocated output arrays ([#12087]).

    * `LU{T,Tridiagonal{T}}` now supports extraction of `L`, `U`, `p`, and `P` factors ([#12137]).

    * Allocations in sparse matrix factorizations are now tracked by Julia's garbage collector ([#12034]).

  * Strings

    * NUL-terminated strings should now be passed to C via the new `Cstring` type, not `Ptr{UInt8}` or `Ptr{Cchar}`,
      in order to check whether the string is free of NUL characters (which would cause silent truncation in C).
      The analogous type `Cwstring` should be used for NUL-terminated `wchar_t*` strings ([#10994]).

    * `graphemes(s)` returns an iterator over grapheme substrings of `s` ([#9261]).

    * Character predicates such as `islower()`, `isspace()`, etc. use
      utf8proc to provide uniform cross-platform behavior and
      up-to-date, locale-independent support for Unicode standards
      ([#5939]).

    * `reverseind` function to convert indices in reversed strings (e.g. from
      reversed regex searches) to indices in the original string ([#9249]).

    * `charwidth(c)` and `strwidth(s)` now return up-to-date cross-platform
      results (via utf8proc) ([#10659]): Julia now likes pizza ([#3721]), but some terminals still don't.

    * `is_valid_char(c)`, (now `isvalid(Char,c)` ([#11241])), now correctly handles Unicode "non-characters", which are valid Unicode codepoints ([#11171]).

    * Backreferences in replacement strings in calls to `replace` with a `Regex` pattern are now supported ([#11849]).
      Use the `s` string prefix to indicate a replacement string contains a backreference. For example, `replace("ab", r"(.)(.)", s"\2\1")` yields "ba".

    * Capture groups in regular expressions can now be named using PCRE syntax, `(?P<group_name>...)`. Capture group matches can be accessed by name by indexing a `Match` object with the name of the group ([#11566]).

    * `countlines()` now counts all lines, not just non-empty ([#11947]).

  * Array and AbstractArray improvements

    * New multidimensional iterators and index types for efficient iteration over `AbstractArray`s. Array iteration should generally be written as `for i in eachindex(A) ... end` rather than `for i = 1:length(A) ... end` ([#8432]).

    * New implementation of SubArrays with substantial performance and functionality improvements ([#8501]).

    * AbstractArray subtypes only need to implement `size` and `getindex`
      for scalar indices to support indexing; all other indexing behaviors
      (including logical indexing, ranges of indices, vectors, colons, etc.) are
      implemented in default fallbacks. Similarly, they only need to implement
      scalar `setindex!` to support all forms of indexed assingment ([#10525]).

    * AbstractArrays that do not extend `similar` now return an `Array` by
      default ([#10525]).

  * Data structures

    * New `sortperm!` function for pre-allocated index arrays ([#8792]).

    * Switch from `O(N)` to `O(log N)` algorithm for `dequeue!(pq, key)`
    with `PriorityQueue`. This provides major speedups for large
    queues ([#8011]).

    * `PriorityQueue` now includes the order type among its
      parameters, `PriorityQueue{KeyType,ValueType,OrderType}`. An
      empty queue can be constructed as `pq =
      PriorityQueue(KeyType,ValueType)`, if you intend to use the
      default `Forward` order, or `pq = PriorityQueue(KeyType,
      ValueType, OrderType)` otherwise ([#8011]).

    * Efficient `mean` and `median` for ranges ([#8089]).

    * `deepcopy` recurses through immutable types and makes copies of their mutable fields ([#8560]).

    * `copy(a::DArray)` will now make a copy of a `DArray` ([#9745]).

  * New types

    * Enums are now supported through the `@enum EnumName EnumValue1
      EnumValue2` syntax. Enum member values also support abitrary
      value assignment by the `@enum EnumName EnumValue1=1
      EnumValue2=10 EnumValue3=20` syntax ([#10168]).

    * New `Dates` module for calendar dates and other time-interval calculations ([#7654]).

    * New `Nullable` type for missing data ([#8152]).

    * A new `Val{T}` type allows one to dispatch on bits-type values ([#9452]).

    * `linspace` now returns a `LinSpace` object which lazily computes linear interpolation of values between the start and stop values. It "lifts" endpoints which are approximately rational in the same manner as the `colon` operator.

  * Arithmetic

    * `convert` now checks for overflow when truncating integers or converting between
    signed and unsigned ([#5413]).

    * Arithmetic is type-preserving for more types; e.g. `(x::Int8) + (y::Int8)` now
    yields an `Int8` ([#3759]).

    * Reductions (e.g. `reduce`, `sum`) widen small types (integers smaller than `Int`, and `Float16`).

    * Added optional rounding argument to floating-point constructors ([#8845]).

    * Equality (`==`) and inequality (`<`/`<=`) comparisons are now correct
      across all numeric types ([#9133], [#9198]).

    * Rational arithmetic throws errors on overflow ([#8672]).

    * Optional `log` and `log1p` functions implemented in pure Julia (experimental) ([#10008]).

    * The `MathConst` type has been renamed `Irrational` ([#11922]).

    * `isapprox` now has simpler and more sensible default tolerances ([#12393]), supports arrays, and has synonyms `â‰ˆ` ([U+2248](http://www.fileformat.info/info/unicode/char/2248/index.htm), LaTeX `\approx`) and `â‰‰` ([U+2249](http://www.fileformat.info/info/unicode/char/2249/index.htm), LaTeX `\napprox`) for `isapprox` and `!isapprox`, respectively ([#12472]).

  * Numbers

    * `primes` is now faster and has been extended to generate the primes in a user defined closed interval ([#12025]).

    * The function `primesmask` which generates a prime sieve for a user defined closed interval is now exported ([#12025]).

  * Random numbers

    * Streamlined random number generation APIs [#8246].
    The default `rand` no longer uses global state in the underlying C library,
    dSFMT, making it closer to being thread-safe ([#8399], [#8832]).
    All APIs can now take an `AbstractRNG` argument ([#8854], [#9065]). The seed argument to `srand` is now optional ([#8320], [#8854]).
    The APIs accepting a range argument are extended to accept an arbitrary
    `AbstractArray` ([#9049]).
    Passing a range of `BigInt` to `rand` or `rand!` is now supported ([#9122]).
    There are speed improvements across the board ([#8808], [#8941], [#8958], [#9083]).

    * Significantly faster `randn` ([#9126], [#9132]).

    * The `randexp` and `randexp!` functions are exported ([#9144]).

  * File

    * Added function `readlink` which returns the value of a symbolic link "path" ([#10714]).

    * Added function `ismount` which checks if a directory is a mount point ([#11279]).

    * The `cp` function now accepts keyword arguments `remove_destination` and `follow_symlinks` ([#10888]).

    * The `mv` function now accepts keyword argument `remove_destination` ([#11145]).

  * `Pipe()` creates a bidirectional I/O object that can be passed to `spawn` or `pipeline`
    for redirecting process streams ([#12739]).

  * Other improvements

    * You can now tab-complete emoji via their [short names](http://www.emoji-cheat-sheet.com/), using `\:name:<tab>` ([#10709]).

    * `gc_enable` subsumes `gc_disable`, and also returns the previous GC state.

    * `assert`, `@assert` now throws an `AssertionError` exception type ([#9734]).

    * `@simd` now rejects invalid control flow (`@goto` / break / continue) in the inner loop body at compile time ([#8624]).

    * The `machinefile` now supports a host count ([#7616]).

    * `code_native` now outputs branch labels ([#8897]).

    * Added `recvfrom` to get source address of UDP packets ([#9418]).

    * `ClusterManager` performance improvements ([#9309]) and support for changing transports([#9434]).

    * Added `Base.get_process_title` / `Base.set_process_title` ([#9957]).

    * `readavailable` now returns a byte vector instead of a string.

    * New `lock` and `unlock` functions, operating on `ReentrantLock`, to lock a stream during
      concurrent writes from multiple tasks ([#10679]).

    * `code_llvm` now outputs stripped IR without debug info or other attached metadata.
      Use `code_llvm_raw` for the unstripped output ([#10747]).

    * New `withenv(var=>val, ...) do ... end` function to temporarily
      modify environment variables ([#10914]).

    * New function `relpath` returns a relative filepath to path either from the current
      directory or from an optional start directory ([#10893]).

    * `mktemp` and `mktempdir` now take an optional argument to set which
      directory the temporary file or directory is created in.

    * New garbage collector tracked memory allocator functions: `jl_malloc`, `jl_calloc`,
    `jl_realloc`, and `jl_free` with libc API ([[#12034]]).

    * `mktempdir` and `mktemp` now have variants that take a function as its
      first argument for automated clean-up ([[#9017]]).

Deprecated or removed
---------------------

  * several syntax whitespace insensitivities have been deprecated ([#11891]).
    ```julia
     # function call
     f (x)

     # getindex
     x [17]
     rand(2) [1]

     # function definition
     f (x) = x^2
     function foo (x)
	x^2
     end
    ```

  * indexing with `Real`s that are not subtypes of `Integer` (`Rational`, `AbstractFloat`, etc.) has been deprecated ([#10458]).

  * `push!(A)` has been deprecated, use `append!` instead of splatting arguments to `push!` ([#10400]).

  * `names` for composite datatypes has been deprecated and
    renamed to `fieldnames` ([#10332]).

  * `DArray` functionality has been removed from `Base` and is now a
    standalone package under the JuliaParallel umbrella organization ([#10333]).

  * The `Graphics` module has been removed from `Base` and is now a
    standalone package ([#10150], [#9862]).

  * The `Woodbury` special matrix type has been removed from `LinAlg` ([#10024]).

  * `median` and `median!` no longer accept a `checknan` keyword argument ([#8605]).

  * `inf` and `nan` are now deprecated in favor of `T(Inf)` and `T(NaN)`, respectively ([#8776]).

  * `oftype(T::Type, x)` is deprecated in favor of `convert(T,x)` (or `T(x)`).

  * `{...}` syntax is deprecated in favor of `Any[...]` ([#8578]).

  * `itrunc`, `ifloor`, `iceil` and `iround` are deprecated in favour of
    `trunc{T<:Integer}(T,x)`, `floor{T<:Integer}(T,x)`, etc.. `trunc` is now
    always bound-checked;`Base.unsafe_trunc` provides the old unchecked `itrunc`
    behaviour ([#9133]).

  * `squeeze` now requires that passed dimension(s) are an `Int` or tuple of `Int`s;
    calling `squeeze` with an arbitrary iterator is deprecated ([#9271]).
    Additionally, passed dimensions must be unique and correspond to extant
    dimensions of the input array.

  * `randbool` is deprecated. Use `rand(Bool)` to produce a random boolean value, and
    `bitrand` to produce a random BitArray ([#9105], [#9569]).

  * `beginswith` is renamed to `startswith` ([#9578]).

  * `null` is renamed to `nullspace` ([#9714]).

  * The operators `|>`, `.>`, `>>`, and `.>>` as used for process I/O redirection
    are replaced with the `pipeline` function ([#5349], [#12739]).

  * `flipud(A)` and `fliplr(A)` have been deprecated in favor of `flipdim(A, 1)` and
    `flipdim(A, 2)`, respectively ([#10446]).

  * Numeric conversion functions whose names are lower-case versions of type
    names have been removed. To convert a scalar, use the type name, e.g.
    `Int32(x)`. To convert an array to a different element type, use
    `Array{T}(x)`, `map(T,x)`, or `round(T,x)`. To parse a string as an integer
    or floating-point number, use `parse` ([#1470], [#6211]).

  * Low-level functions from the C library and dynamic linker have been moved to
    modules `Libc` and `Libdl`, respectively ([#10328]).

  * The functions `parseint`, `parsefloat`, `float32_isvalid`,
  `float64_isvalid`, and the string-argument `BigInt` and `BigFloat` have
  been replaced by `parse` and `tryparse` with a type argument. The string
  macro `big"xx"` can be used to construct `BigInt` and `BigFloat` literals
  ([#3631], [#5704], [#9487], [#10543], [#10955]).

  * the `--int-literals` compiler option is no longer accepted ([#9597]).

  * Instead of `linrange`, use `linspace` ([#9666]).

  * The functions `is_valid_char`, `is_valid_ascii`, `is_valid_utf8`, `is_valid_utf16`, and
    `is_valid_utf32` have been replaced by generic `isvalid` methods.
    The single argument form `isvalid(value)` can now be used for values of type `Char`, `ASCIIString`,
    `UTF8String`, `UTF16String` and `UTF32String`.
    The two argument form `isvalid(type, value)` can be used with the above types, with values
    of type `Vector{UInt8}`, `Vector{UInt16}`, `Vector{UInt32}`, and `Vector{Char}` ([#11241]).

  * Instead of `utf32(64,123,...)` use `utf32(UInt32[64,123,...])` ([#11379]).

  * `start_timer` and `stop_timer` are replaced by `Timer` and `close`.

  * The following internal julia C functions have been renamed, in order to prevent
    potential naming conflicts with C libraries: ([#11741])

    * `gc_wb*` -> `jl_gc_wb*`

    * `gc_queue_root` -> `jl_gc_queue_root`

    * `allocobj` -> `jl_gc_allocobj`

    * `alloc_[0-3]w` -> `jl_gc_alloc_*w`

    * `diff_gc_total_bytes` -> `jl_gc_diff_total_bytes`

    * `sync_gc_total_bytes` -> `jl_gc_sync_total_bytes`

  * `require(::AbstractString)` and `reload` (see news about addition of `compile`).

  * `cartesianmap` is deprecated in favor of iterating over a `CartesianRange`

Julia v0.3.0 Release Notes
==========================

New language features
---------------------

  * Greatly enhanced performance for passing and returning `Tuple`s ([#4042]).

  * `Tuple`s (of `Integer`s, `Symbol`s, or `Bool`s) can now be used as type
    parameters ([#5164]).

  * An additional default "inner" constructor accepting any arguments is now
    generated. Constructors that look like `MyType(a, b) = new(a, b)` do not
    need to be added manually ([#4026], [#7071]).

  * Expanded array type hierarchy to include an abstract `DenseArray` for
    in-memory arrays with standard strided storage ([#987], [#2345],
    [#6212]).

  * When reloading code, types whose definitions have not changed can be
    ignored in some cases.

  * Binary `~` now parses as a vararg macro call to `@~`.
    For example `x~y~z` => `@~ x y z` ([#4882]).

  * Structure fields can now be accessed by index ([#4806]).

  * If a module contains a function `__init__()`, it will be called when
    the module is first loaded, and on process startup if a pre-compiled
    version of the module is present ([#1268]).

  * Multi-line comments ([#69], [#6128]): `#= .... =#`

  * `--check-bounds=yes|no` compiler option

  * Unicode identifiers are normalized (NFC) so that different encodings
    of equivalent strings are treated as the same identifier ([#5462]).

  * The set of characters permitted in identifiers has been restricted based
    on Unicode categories. Generally, punctuation, formatting and control
    characters, and operator symbols are not allowed in identifiers.
    Number-like characters cannot begin identifiers ([#5936]).

  * Define a limited number of infix Unicode operators ([#552], [#6582]):

    | Precedence class | Operators (with synonyms, if any)
    | ---------------- | ---------------------------------
    |   ==             |  â‰¥ (>=) â‰¤ (<=) â‰¡ (===) â‰  (!=) â‰¢ (!==) .â‰¥ (.>=) .â‰¤ (.<=) .!= (.â‰ ) âˆˆ (`in`) âˆ‰ (`(x,y)->!in(x, y)`) âˆ‹ (`(x,y)->in(y, x)`) âˆŒ (`(x,y)->!in(y, x)`) âŠ† (`issubset`) âŠˆ (`(x,y)->!issubset(x, y)`) âŠŠ (`(x,y)->xâŠ†y && x!=y`) |
    |   +              | âˆª (`union`) |
    |   *              | Ã· (`div`) â‹… (`dot`) Ã— (`cross`) âˆ© (`intersect`) |
    |   unary          | âˆš âˆ› |

    In addition to these, many of the Unicode operator symbols are parsed
    as infix operators and are available for user-defined methods ([#6929]).

  * Improved reporting of syntax errors ([#6179])

  * `break` inside a `for` loop with multiple ranges now exits the entire loop nest ([#5154])

  * Local goto statements using the `@goto` and `@label` macros ([#101]).

REPL improvements
-----------------

  * New native-Julia REPL implementation, eliminating many problems
    stemming from the old GNU Readline-based REPL ([#6270]).

  * Tab-substitution of LaTeX math symbols (e.g. `\alpha` by `Î±`) ([#6911]).
    This also works in IJulia and in Emacs ([#6920]).

  * `workspace()` function for obtaining a fresh workspace ([#1195]).

Library improvements
--------------------

  * `isequal` now compares all numbers by value, ignoring type ([#6624]).

  * Implement limited shared-memory parallelism with `SharedArray`s ([#5380]).

  * Well-behaved floating-point ranges ([#2333], [#5636]).
    Introduced the `FloatRange` type for floating-point ranges with a step,
    which will give intuitive/correct results for classically problematic
    ranges like `0.1:0.1:0.3`, `0.0:0.7:2.1` or `1.0:1/49:27.0`.

  * `mod2pi` function ([#4799], [#4862]).

  * New functions `minmax` and `extrema` ([#5275]).

  * New macros `@edit`, `@less`, `@code_typed`, `@code_lowered`, `@code_llvm` and `@code_native` that all function like `@which` ([#5832]).

  * `consume(p)` extended to `consume(p, args...)`, allowing it
    to optionally pass `args...` back to the producer ([#4775]).

  * `.juliarc.jl` is now loaded for both script and REPL execution ([#5076]).

  * The `Sys` module now includes convenient functions for working with
    dynamic library handles; `Sys.dllist` will list out all paths currently
    loaded via `dlopen`, and `Sys.dlpath` will lookup a path from a handle

  * `readdlm` treats multiple whitespace characters as a single delimiter
    by default (when no delimiter is specified). This is useful for reading
    fixed-width or messy whitespace-delimited data ([#5403]).

  * The Airy, Bessel, Hankel, and related functions (`airy*`,
    `bessel*`, `hankel*`) now detect errors returned by the underlying
    AMOS library, throwing an `AmosException` in that case ([#4967]).

  * `methodswith` now returns an array of `Method`s ([#5464]) rather
    than just printing its results.

  * `errno([code])` function to get or set the C library's `errno`.

  * `GitHub` module for interacting with the GitHub API.

  * Package improvements

    * Packages are now installed into `.julia/v0.3` by default (or
      whatever the current Julia version is), so that different
      versions of Julia can co-exist with incompatible packages.
      Existing `.julia` installations are unaffected unless `Pkg.init()`
      is run to re-create the package directories ([#3344], [#5737]).

    * `Pkg.submit(pkg[,commit])` function to automatically submit
      a GitHub pull request to the package author.

  * Collections improvements

    * `Array` assignment (e.g. `x[:] = y`) ignores singleton dimensions
      and allows the last dimension of one side to match all trailing dimensions
      of the other ([#4048], [#4383]).

    * `Dict(kv)` constructor for any iterator on `(key,value)` pairs.

    * Multi-key `Dict`s: `D[x,y...]` is now a synonym for `D[(x,y...)]`
      for associations `D` ([#4870]).

    * `push!` and `unshift!` can push multiple arguments ([#4782]).

    * `writedlm` and `writecsv` now accept any iterable collection of
      iterable rows, in addition to `AbstractArray` arguments, and the
      `writedlm` delimiter can be any printable object (e.g. a
      `String`) instead of just a `Char`.

    * `isempty` now works for any iterable collection ([#5827]).

    * `unique` now accepts an optional `dim` argument for finding
      unique rows or columns of a matrix or regions of a
      multidimensional array ([#5811]).

  * `Number` improvements

    * The `ImaginaryUnit` type no longer exists. Instead, `im` is of type
      `Complex{Bool}`. Making this work required changing the semantics of
      boolean multiplication to approximately, `true * x = x` and
      `false * x = zero(x)`, which can itself be considered useful ([#5468]).

    * `big` is now vectorized ([#4766])

    * `nextpow` and `prevpow` now return the `a^n` values instead of the
      exponent `n` ([#4819])

    * Overflow detection in `parseint` ([#4874]).

    * `rand` now supports arbitrary `Ranges` arguments ([#5059]).

    * `expm1` and `log1p` now support complex arguments ([#3141]).

    * Broadcasting `.//` is now included ([#7094]).

    * `prevfloat` and `nextfloat` now saturate at -Inf and Inf,
      respectively, and have otherwise been fixed to follow the IEEE-754
      standard functions `nextDown` and `nextUp` ([#5025]).

    * New function `widen` for widening numeric types and values, and `widemul`
      for multiplying to a larger type ([#6169]).

    * `polygamma`, `digamma`, and `trigamma` now accept complex
      arguments, and `zeta(s, z)` now provides the Hurwitz zeta ([#7125]).

    * Narrow integer types (< 32 bits) are promoted to `Float64` rather
      than to `Float32` by `float(x)` ([#7390]).

  * `String` improvements

    * Triple-quoted regex strings, `r"""..."""` ([#4934]).

    * New string type, `UTF16String` ([#4930]), constructed by
      `utf16(s)` from another string, a `Uint16` array or pointer, or
      a byte array (possibly prefixed by a byte-order marker to
      indicate endian-ness).  Its data is internally `NULL`-terminated
      for passing to C ([#7016]).

    * `CharString` is renamed to `UTF32String` ([#4943]), and its data
      is now internally `NULL`-terminated for passing to C ([#7016]).
      `CharString(c::Char...)` is deprecated in favor of `utf32(c...)`,
      and `utf32(s)` otherwise has functionality similar to `utf16(s)`.

    * New `WString` and `wstring` synonyms for either `UTF16String`
      and `utf16` or `UTF32String` and `utf32`, respectively, depending
      on the width of `Cwchar_t` ([#7016]).

    * `normalize_string` function to perform Unicode normalization,
      case-folding, and other transformations ([#5576]).

    * `pointer(s, i=1)` for `ByteString`, `UTF16String`, `UTF32String`,
      and `SubString`s thereof ([#5703]).

    * `bytestring` is automatically called on `String` arguments for
      conversion to `Ptr{Uint8}` in `ccall` ([#5677]).

  * Linear algebra improvements

      * Balancing options for eigenvector calculations for general matrices ([#5428]).

      * Mutating linear algebra functions no longer promote ([#5526]).

      * `condskeel` for Skeel condition numbers ([#5726]).

      * `norm(::Matrix)` no longer calculates a vector norm when the first
        dimension is one ([#5545]); it always uses the operator (induced)
        matrix norm.

      * New `vecnorm(itr, p=2)` function that computes the norm of
        any iterable collection of numbers as if it were a vector of
        the same length.  This generalizes and replaces `normfro` ([#6057]),
        and `norm` is now type-stable ([#6056]).

      * New `UniformScaling` matrix type and identity `I` constant ([#5810]).

      * None of the concrete matrix factorization types are exported from `Base`
        by default anymore.

    * Sparse linear algebra

      * 1-d sparse `getindex` has been implemented ([#7047])

      * Faster sparse `getindex` ([#7131]).

      * Faster sparse `kron` ([#4958]).

      * `sparse(A) \ B` now supports a matrix `B` of right-hand sides ([#5196]).

      * `eigs(A, sigma)` now uses shift-and-invert for nonzero shifts `sigma` and inverse iteration for `which="SM"`. If `sigma==nothing` (the new default), computes ordinary (forward) iterations ([#5776]).

      * `sprand` is faster, and whether any entry is nonzero is now determined independently with the specified probability ([#6726]).

    * Dense linear algebra for special matrix types

      * Interconversions between the special matrix types `Diagonal`, `Bidiagonal`,
        `SymTridiagonal`, `Triangular`, and `Triangular`, and `Matrix` are now allowed
        for matrices which are representable in both source and destination types ([5e3f074b]).

      * Allow for addition and subtraction over mixed matrix types, automatically promoting
        the result to the denser matrix type ([a448e080], [#5927])

      * new algorithms for linear solvers and eigensystems of `Bidiagonal`
        matrices of generic element types ([#5277])

      * new algorithms for linear solvers, eigensystems and singular systems of `Diagonal`
        matrices of generic element types ([#5263])

      * new algorithms for linear solvers and eigensystems of `Triangular`
        matrices of generic element types ([#5255])

      * specialized `inv` and `det` methods for `Tridiagonal` and `SymTridiagonal`
        based on recurrence relations between principal minors ([#5358])

      * specialized `transpose`, `ctranspose`, `istril`, `istriu` methods for
        `Triangular` ([#5255]) and `Bidiagonal` ([#5277])

      * new LAPACK wrappers
        - condition number estimate `cond(A::Triangular)` ([#5255])

      * parametrize `Triangular` on matrix type ([#7064])

      * Lyapunov / Sylvester solver ([#7435])

      * `eigvals` for `Symmetric`, `Tridiagonal` and `Hermitian` matrices now
        support additional method signatures: ([#3688], [#6652], [#6678], [#7647])
        - `eigvals(M, el, eu)` finds all eigenvalues in the interval `(el, eu]`
        - `eigvals(M, il:iu)` finds the `il`th through the `iu`th eigenvalues (in ascending order)

    * Dense linear algebra for generic matrix element types

      * LU factorization ([#5381] and [#5430])

      * QR factorization ([#5526])

  * New function `deleteat!` deletes a specified index or indices and
    returns the updated collection

  * The `setenv` function for external processes now accepts a `dir` keyword
    argument for specifying the directory to start the child process in ([#4888]).

  * Constructors for collections (`Set`, `Dict`, etc.) now generally accept a
    single iterable argument giving the elements of the collection ([#4996], [#4871])

  * Ranges and arrays with the same elements are now unequal. This allows hashing
    and comparing ranges to be faster ([#5778]).

  * Broadcasting now works on arbitrary `AbstractArrays` ([#5387])

  * Reduction functions that accept a pre-allocated output array, including
    `sum!`, `prod!`, `maximum!`, `minimum!`, `all!`, `any!` ([#6197], [#5387])

  * Faster performance on `fill!` and `copy!` for array types not supporting
    efficient linear indexing ([#5671], [#5387])

  * Changes to range types ([#5585])

    * `Range` is now the abstract range type, instead of `Ranges`

    * New function `range` for constructing ranges by length

    * `Range` is now `StepRange`, and `Range1` is now `UnitRange`. Their
      constructors accept end points instead of lengths. Both are subtypes of a
      new abstract type `OrdinalRange`.

    * Ranges now support `BigInt` and general ordinal types.

    * Very large ranges (e.g. `0:typemax(Int)`) can now be constructed, but some
      operations (e.g. `length`) will raise an `OverflowError`.

  * Extended API for `cov` and `cor`, which accept keyword arguments `vardim`,
    `corrected`, and `mean` ([#6273])

  * New functions `randsubseq` and `randsubseq!` to create a random subsequence of an array ([#6726])

  * New macro `@evalpoly` for efficient inline evaluation of polynomials ([#7146]).

  * The signal filtering function `filt` now accepts an optional initial filter state vector. A new in-place function `filt!` is also exported ([#7513]).

  * Significantly faster `cumsum` and `cumprod` ([#7359]).

  * Implement `findmin` and `findmax` over specified array dimensions ([#6716]).

  * Support memory-mapping of files with offsets on Windows ([#7242]).

  * Catch writes to protect memory, such as when trying to modify a mmapped file opened in read-only mode ([#3434]).

Environment improvements
------------------------

  * New `--code-coverage` and `--track-allocation` startup features allow one to measure the number of executions or the amount of memory allocated, respectively, at each line of code ([#5423],[#7464]).

  * `Profile.init` now accepts keyword arguments, and returns the current settings when no arguments are supplied ([#7365]).

Build improvements
------------------

  * Dependencies are now verified against stored MD5/SHA512 hashes, to ensure
    that the correct file has been downloaded and was not modified ([#6773]).


Deprecated or removed
---------------------

  * `convert(Ptr{T1}, x::Array{T2})` is now deprecated unless `T1 == T2`
    or `T1 == Void` ([#6073]).  (You can still explicitly `convert`
    one pointer type into another if needed.)

  * `Sys.shlib_ext` has been renamed to `Sys.dlext`

  * `dense` is deprecated in favor of `full` ([#4759]).

  * The `Stat` type is renamed `StatStruct` ([#4670]).

  * `setrounding`, `rounding` and `setrounding` now take an additional
    argument specifying the floating point type to which they apply. The old
    behaviour and `[get/set/with]_bigfloat_rounding` functions are deprecated ([#5007]).

  * `cholpfact` and `qrpfact` are deprecated in favor of keyword arguments in
    `cholfact(..., pivot=true)` and `qrfact(..., pivot=true)` ([#5330]).

  * `myindexes` has been renamed to `localindexes` ([#5475]).

  * `factorize!` is deprecated in favor of `factorize` ([#5526]).

  * `nnz` counts the number of structural nonzeros in a sparse
    matrix. Use `countnz` for the actual number of nonzeros ([#6769]).

  * `setfield` is renamed `setfield!` ([#5748]).

  * `put` and `take` are renamed `put!` and `take!` ([#5511]).

  * `put!` now returns its first argument, the remote reference ([#5819]).

  * `read` methods that modify a passed array are now called `read!` ([#5970])

  * `infs` and `nans` are deprecated in favor of the more general `fill`.

  * `*` and `div` are no longer supported for `Char`.

  * `Range` is renamed `StepRange` and `Range1` is renamed `UnitRange`.
    `Ranges` is renamed `Range`.

  * `bitmix` is replaced by a 2-argument form of `hash`.

  * `readsfrom` and `writesto` are replaced by `open` ([#6948]).

    * `start_reading`, `stop_reading`, `start_watching` ([#10885]).

Julia v0.2.0 Release Notes
==========================

The 0.2 release brings improvements to many areas of Julia. Among the
most visible changes are support for 64-bit Windows, keyword arguments
to functions, immutable types, a redesigned and polished package
manager, a multimedia interface supporting usage of Julia in IPython,
a built-in profiler, and major improvements to Julia's linear algebra,
I/O, and parallel capabilities. These are accompanied by many other
changes adding new features, enhancing the library's consistency,
improving performance, increasing test coverage, easing installation,
and expanding the documentation. While not part of Julia proper, the
package ecosystem has also grown and matured considerably since the
0.1 release. See below for more information about the long list of
changes that improve Julia's usability and performance.

New language features
---------------------

  * Keyword & optional function arguments ([#485], [#1817]).

  * Immutable types ([#13]).

  * Triple-quoted string literals ([#70]).

  * New infix operator `in` (e.g. `x in S`), and corresponding function
    `in(x,S)`, replacing `contains(S,x)` function ([#2703]).

  * New variable bindings on each for loop and comprehension iteration ([#1571]).
    For example, before this change:

        julia> map(f->f(), { ()->i for i=1:3 })
        3-element Any Array:
         3
         3
         3

    and after:

        julia> map(f->f(), { ()->i for i=1:3 })
        3-element Any Array:
         1
         2
         3

  * Explicit relative importing ([#2375]).

  * Methods can be added to functions in other modules using dot syntax,
    as in `Foo.bar(x) = 0`.

  * `import module: name1, name2, ...` ([#5214]).

  * A semicolon is now allowed after an `import` or `using` statement ([#4130]).

  * In an interactive session (REPL), you can use `;cmd` to run `cmd` via an interactive
    shell. For example:

New library functions
---------------------

  * Sampling profiler ([#2597]).

  * Functions for examining stages of the compiler's output:
    `code_lowered`, `code_typed`, `code_llvm`, and `code_native`.

  * Multimedia I/O API (display, writemime, etcetera) ([#3932]).

  * MPFR-based `BigFloat` ([#2814]), and many new `BigFloat` operations.

  * New half-precision IEEE floating-point type, `Float16` ([#3467]).

  * Support for setting floating-point rounding modes ([#3149]).

  * `methodswith` shows all methods with an argument of specific type.

  * `mapslices` provides a general way to perform operations on slices of arrays ([#2204]).

  * `repeat` function for constructing Arrays with repeated elements ([#3605]).

  * `Collections.PriorityQueue` type and `Collections.heap` functions ([#2920]).

  * `quadgk` 1d-integration routine ([#3140]).

  * `erfinv` and `erfcinv` functions ([#2987]).

  * `varm`, `stdm` ([#2265]).

  * `digamma`, `invdigamma`, `trigamma` and `polygamma` for calculating derivatives of `gamma` function ([#3233]).

  * `logdet` ([#3070]).

  * Names for C-compatible types: `Cchar`, `Clong`, etc. ([#2370]).

  * `cglobal` to access global variables ([#1815]).

  * `unsafe_pointer_to_objref` ([#2468]) and `pointer_from_objref` ([#2515]).

  * `readandwrite` for external processes.

  * I/O functions `readbytes` and `readbytes!` ([#3878]).

  * `flush_cstdio` function ([#3949]).

  * ClusterManager makes it possible to support different types of compute clusters
    ([#3649], [#4014]).

  * `rmprocs` for removing processors from a parallel computing session.
    The system can also tolerate to some extent processors that die unexpectedly
    ([#3050]).

  * `interrupt` for interrupting worker processes ([#3819]).

  * `timedwait` does a polled wait for an event till a specified timeout.

  * `Condition` type with `wait` and `notify` functions for `Task` synchronization.

  * `versioninfo` provides detailed version information, especially useful when
    reporting and diagnosing bugs.

  * `detach` for running child processes in a separate process group.

  * `setenv` for passing environment variables to child processes.

  * `ifelse` eagerly-evaluated conditional function, especially useful for
    vectorized conditionals.

Library improvements
--------------------

  * `isequal` now returns `false` for numbers of different types.
    This makes it much easier to define hashing for new numeric types.
    Uses of `Dict` with numeric keys might need to change
    to account for this increased strictness.

  * A redesigned and rewritten `Pkg` system is much more robust in case of problems.
    The basic interface to adding and removing package requirements remains the
    same, but great deal of additional functionality for developing packages in-place
    was added. See the new [packages chapter] in the manual for further details.

  * Sorting API updates ([#3665]) â€“ see [sorting functions].

  * The `delete!(d::Dict, key)` function has been split into separate `pop!`
    and `delete!` functions ([#3439]).
    `pop!(d,key)` removes `key` from `d` and returns the value that was associated with it;
    it throws an exception if `d` does not contain `key`.
    `delete!(d,key)` removes `key` from `d` and succeeds regardless of whether `d`
    contained `key` or not, returning `d` itself in either case.

  * Linear-algebra factorization routines (`lu`, `chol`, etc.) now return
    `Factorization` objects (and `lud`, `chold`, etc. are deprecated; [#2212]).

  * A number of improvements to sparse matrix capabilities and sparse linear algebra.

  * More linear algebra fixes and eigensolver hooks
    for `SymTridiagonal`, `Tridiagonal` and `Bidiagonal` matrix types
    ([#2606], [#2608], [#2609], [#2611], [#2678], [#2713], [#2720], [#2725]).

  * Change `integer_valued`, `real_valued`, and so on to `isinteger`, `isreal`,
    and so on, and semantics of the later are now value-based rather than type-based,
    unlike MATLAB/Octave ([#3071]). `isbool` and `iscomplex` are eliminated in favor
    of a general `iseltype` function.

  * Transitive comparison of floats with rationals ([#3102]).

  * Fast prime generation with `primes` and fast primality testing with `isprime`.

  * `sum` and `cumsum` now use [pairwise summation] for better accuracy ([#4039]).

  * Dot operators (`.+`, `.*` etc.) now broadcast singleton dimensions of array arguments.
    This behavior can be applied to any function using `broadcast(f, ...)`.

  * `combinations`, `permutations`, and `partitions` now return iterators instead of a task,
    and `integer_partitions` has been renamed to `partitions` ([#3989], [#4055]).

  * `isreadable`/`iswritable` methods added for more IO types ([#3872]).

  * Much faster and improved `readdlm` and `writedlm` ([#3350], [#3468], [#3483]).

  * Faster `matchall` ([#3719]), and various string and regex improvements.

  * Documentation of advanced linear algebra features ([#2807]).

  * Support optional RTLD flags in `dlopen` ([#2380]).

  * `pmap` now works with any iterable collection.

  * Options in `pmap` for retrying or ignoring failed tasks.

  * New `sinpi(x)` and `cospi(x)` functions to compute sine and cosine of `pi*x`
    more accurately ([#4112]).

  * New implementations of elementary complex functions
    `sqrt`, `log`, `asin`, `acos`, `atan`, `tanh`, `asinh`, `acosh`, `atanh`
    with correct branch cuts ([#2891]).

  * Improved behavior of `SubArray` ([#4412], [#4284], [#4044], [#3697], [#3790],
    [#3148], [#2844], [#2644] and various other fixes).

  * New convenience functions in graphics API.

  * Improved backtraces on Windows and OS X.

  * Implementation of reduction functions (including `reduce`, `mapreduce`, `sum`, `prod`,
    `maximum`, `minimum`, `all`, and `any`) are refactored, with improved type stability,
    efficiency, and consistency ([#6116], [#7035], [#7061], [#7106]).

Deprecated or removed
---------------------

  * Methods of `min` and `max` that do reductions were renamed to
    `minimum` and `maximum`. `min(x)` is now `minimum(x)`, and
    `min(x,(),dim)` is now `minimum(x,dim)` ([#4235]).

  * `ComplexPair` was renamed to `Complex` and made `immutable`,
    and `Complex128` and so on are now aliases to the new `Complex` type.

  * `!` was added to the name of many mutating functions,
    e.g., `push` was renamed `push!` ([#907]).

  * `ref` renamed to `getindex`, and `assign` to `setindex!` ([#1484]).

  * `writeable` renamed to `writable` ([#3874]).

  * `logb` and `ilogb` renamed to `exponent` ([#2516]).

  * `quote_string` became a method of `repr`.

  * `safe_char`, `check_ascii`, and `check_utf8` replaced by
    `is_valid_char`, `is_valid_ascii`, and `is_valid_utf8`, respectively.

  * `each_line`, `each_match`, `begins_with`, `ends_with`, `parse_float`,
    `parse_int`, and `seek_end` replaced by: `eachline`, `eachmatch`, and so on
    (`_` was removed) ([#1539]).

  * `parse_bin(s)` replaced by `parseint(s,2)`;
    `parse_oct(s)` replaced by `parseint(s,8)`;
    `parse_hex(s)` replaced by `parseint(s,16)`.

  * `findn_nzs` replaced by `findnz` ([#1539]).

  * `DivideByZeroError` replaced by `DivideError`.

  * `addprocs_ssh`, `addprocs_ssh_tunnel`, and `addprocs_local`
    replaced by `addprocs` (with keyword options).

  * `remote_call`, `remote_call_fetch`, and `remote_call_wait`
    replaced by `remotecall`, `remotecall_fetch`, and `remotecall_wait`.

  * `has` replaced by `in` for sets and by `haskey` for dictionaries.

  * `diagmm` and `diagmm!` replaced by `scale` and `scale!` ([#2916]).

  * `unsafe_ref` and `unsafe_assign` replaced by `unsafe_load` and `unsafe_store!`.

  * `add_each!` and `del_each!` replaced by `union!` and `setdiff!`.

  * `isdenormal` renamed to `issubnormal` ([#3105]).

  * `expr` replaced by direct call to `Expr` constructor.

  * `|`, `&`, `$`, `-`, and `~` for sets replaced by
    `union`, `intersect`, `symdiff`, `setdiff`, and `complement` ([#3272]).

  * `square` function removed.

  * `pascal` function removed.

  * `add` and `add!` for `Set` replaced by `push!`.

  * `ls` function deprecated in favor of `readdir` or `;ls` in the REPL.

  * `start_timer` now expects arguments in units of seconds, not milliseconds.

  * Shell redirection operators `|`, `>`, and `<` eliminated in favor of a new
    operator `|>` ([#3523]).

  * `amap` is deprecated in favor of new `mapslices` functionality.

  * The `Reverse` iterator was removed since it did not work in many cases.

  * The `gcd` function now returns a non-negative value regardless of
    the argument signs, and various other sign problems with `invmod`,
    `lcm`, `gcdx`, and `powermod` were fixed ([#4811]).

Miscellaneous changes
---------------------

  * `julia-release-*` executables renamed to `julia-*`,
    and `libjulia-release` renamed to `libjulia` ([#4177]).

  * Packages will now be installed in `.julia/vX.Y`, where
    X.Y is the current Julia version.
