Julia v1.13 Release Notes
========================

New language features
---------------------

  - New `Base.@acquire` macro for a non-closure version of `Base.acquire(f, s::Base.Semaphore)`, like `@lock`. ([#56845])

Language changes
----------------
* `mod(x::AbstractFloat, -Inf)` now returns `x` (as long as `x` is finite), this aligns with C standard and
is considered a bug fix ([#47102])

Compiler/Runtime improvements
-----------------------------

Command-line option changes
---------------------------

Multi-threading changes
-----------------------

Build system changes
--------------------

New library functions
---------------------

* Exporting function `fieldindex` to get the index of a struct's field ([#58119]).

New library features
--------------------

* `fieldoffset` now also accepts the field name as a symbol as `fieldtype` already did ([#58100]).
* `sort(keys(::Dict))` and `sort(values(::Dict))` now automatically collect, they previously threw ([#56978]).
* `Base.AbstractOneTo` is added as a supertype of one-based axes, with `Base.OneTo` as its subtype ([#56902]).

Standard library changes
------------------------

#### JuliaSyntaxHighlighting

#### LinearAlgebra

#### Profile

#### REPL

#### Test

* Test failures when using the `@test` macro now show evaluated arguments for all function calls ([#57825], [#57839]).

#### InteractiveUtils

* Introspection utilities such as `@code_typed`, `@which` and `@edit` now accept type annotations as substitutes for values, recognizing forms such as `f(1, ::Float64, 3)` or even `sum(::Vector{T}; init = ::T) where {T<:Real}`. Type-annotated variables as in `f(val::Int; kw::Float64)` are not evaluated if the type annotation provides the necessary information, making this syntax compatible with signatures found in stacktraces ([#57909], [#58222]).

External dependencies
