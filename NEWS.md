Julia v1.5 Release Notes
========================

New language features
---------------------
* Macro calls `@foo {...}` can now also be written `@foo{...}` (without the space) ([#34498]).

Language changes
----------------

* Converting arbitrary tuples to `NTuple`, e.g. `convert(NTuple, (1, ""))` now gives an error,
  where it used to be incorrectly allowed. This is because `NTuple` refers only to homogeneous
  tuples (this meaning has not changed) ([#34272]).

* In docstrings, a level-1 markdown header "Extended help" is now
  interpreted as a marker dividing "brief help" from "extended help."
  The REPL help mode only shows the brief help (the content before the
  "Extended help" header) by default; prepend the expression with '?'
  (in addition to the one that enters the help mode) to see the full
  docstring. ([#25930])


Multi-threading changes
-----------------------


Build system changes
--------------------


New library functions
---------------------
* `Iterators.map` is added. It provides another syntax `Iterators.map(f, iterators...)`
  for writing `(f(args...) for args in zip(iterators...))`, i.e. a lazy `map` ([#34352]).
* The new `isdisjoint` function indicates whether two collections are disjoint ([#34427]).

New library features
--------------------
* Function composition now works also on one argument `âˆ˜(f) = f` (#34251)


Standard library changes
------------------------
* The `@timed` macro now returns a `NamedTuple` ([#34149])

#### LinearAlgebra
* The BLAS submodule now supports the level-2 BLAS subroutine `hpmv!` ([#34211]).
* `normalize` now supports multidimensional arrays ([#34239])
* `lq` factorizations can now be used to compute the minimum-norm solution to under-determined systems ([#34350]).

#### Markdown


#### Random


#### REPL


#### SparseArrays
* `lu!` accepts `UmfpackLU` as an argument to make use of its symbolic factorization.

#### Dates

#### Statistics


#### Sockets
