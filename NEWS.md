Julia v1.2 Release Notes
========================

New language features
---------------------

* The `extrema` function now accepts a function argument in the same manner as `minimum` and
  `maximum` ([#30323]).

Multi-threading changes
-----------------------

  * The `Condition` type now has a thread-safe replacement, accessed as `Threads.Condition`.
    With that addition, task scheduling primitives such as `ReentrantLock` are now thread-safe ([#30061]).

Language changes
----------------

* `Enum` now behaves like a scalar when used in broadcasting ([#30670]).

Command-line option changes
---------------------------


New library functions
---------------------

* `getipaddrs()` function returns all the IP addresses of the local machine ([#30349])

Standard library changes
------------------------

#### LinearAlgebra

* Added keyword arguments `rtol`, `atol` to `pinv` and `nullspace` ([#29998]).
* `UniformScaling` instances are now callable such that e.g. `I(3)` will produce a `Diagonal` matrix ([#30298]).

#### SparseArrays

* performance improvements for sparse matrix-matrix multiplication ([#30372]).
* Sparse vector outer products are more performant and maintain sparsity in products of the
  form `kron(u, v')`, `u * v'`, and `u .* v'` where `u` and `v` are sparse vectors or column
  views. ([#24980])

#### Dates

* Fixed `repr` such that it displays `DateTime` as it would be entered in Julia ([#30200]).

#### Miscellaneous

* Since environment variables on Windows are case-insensitive, `ENV` now converts its keys
  to uppercase for display, iteration, and copying ([#30593]).

External dependencies
---------------------

* libgit2 has been updated to v0.27.7 ([#30584]).
* OpenBLAS has been updated to v0.3.5 ([#30583]).
* MbedTLS has been updated to v2.16.0 ([#30618]).

Deprecated or removed
---------------------
