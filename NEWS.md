Julia v1.1.0 Release Notes
==========================

New language features
---------------------

  * An *exception stack* is maintained on each task to make exception handling more robust and enable root cause analysis using `catch_stack` ([#28878]).
  * The experimental macro `Base.@locals` returns a dictionary of current local variable names
    and values ([#29733]).

Language changes
----------------

  * Parser inputs ending with a comma are now consistently treated as incomplete.
    Previously they were sometimes parsed as tuples, depending on whitespace ([#28506]).
  * Spaces were accidentally allowed in broadcast call syntax, e.g. `f. (x)`. They are now
    disallowed, consistent with normal function call syntax ([#29781]).
  * Big integer literals and command syntax (backticks) are now parsed with the name of
    the macro (`@int128_str`, `@uint128_str`, `@big_str`, `@cmd`) qualified to refer
    to the `Core` module ([#29968]).
  * Using the same name for both a local variable and a static parameter is now an error instead
    of a warning ([#29429]).

Command-line option changes
---------------------------

  * When a script run in interactive mode (`-i`) throws an error, the REPL now starts after
    the error is displayed. Previously the REPL only started if the script completed without
    error ([#21233]).

New library functions
---------------------

  * `splitpath(p::String)` function, which is the opposite of `joinpath(parts...)`: it splits a filepath into its components ([#28156]).
  * `isnothing(::Any)` function, to check whether something is a `Nothing`, returns a `Bool` ([#29679]).
  * `getpid(::Process)` method ([#24064]).

Standard library changes
------------------------

  * `CartesianIndices` can now be constructed from two `CartesianIndex`es `I` and `J` with `I:J` ([#29440]).
  * `CartesianIndices` support broadcasting arithmetic (+ and -) with a `CartesianIndex` ([#29890]).
  * `copy!` support for arrays, dicts, and sets has been moved to Base from the Future package ([#29173]).
  * Channels now convert inserted values (like containers) instead of requiring types to match ([#29092]).
  * `range` can accept the stop value as a positional argument, e.g. `range(1,10,step=2)` ([#28708]).
  * `edit` can now be called on a module to edit the file that defines it ([#29636]).
  * `diff` now supports arrays of arbitrary dimensionality and can operate over any dimension ([#29827]).
  * `sprandn` now supports result types like `ComplexF64` or `Float32` ([#30083]).
  * All compiler-reflection tools (i.e. the `code_` class of functions and macros) now print accurate
    line number and inlining information in a common style, and take an optional parameter (debuginfo=:default)
    to control the verbosity of the metadata shown ([#29893]).
  * The constructor `BigFloat(::BigFloat)` now respects the global precision setting and always
    returns a `BigFloat` with precision equal to `precision(BigFloat)` ([#29127]). The optional
    `precision` argument to override the global setting is now a keyword instead of positional
    argument ([#29157]).
  * `Regex` and `TimeZone` now behave like scalars when used in broadcasting ([#29913], [#30159]).
  * `Char` now behaves like a read-only 0-dimensional array ([#29819]).
  * `parse` now allows strings representing integer 0 and 1 for type `Bool` ([#29980]).
  * `Base.tail` now works on named tuples ([#29595]).
  * `randperm` and `randcycle` now use the type of their argument to determine the element type of
    the returned array ([#29670]).

Compiler/Runtime improvements
-----------------------------


Deprecated or removed
---------------------

  * `one(i::CartesianIndex)` should be replaced with `oneunit(i::CartesianIndex)` ([#29442]).
  * The internal array `Base.Grisu.DIGITS` is deprecated; new code should use `Base.Grisu.getbuf()`
    to get an appropriate task-local buffer and pass it to `grisu()` instead ([#29907]).
  * The internal function `Base._default_type(T)` has been removed. Calls to it should be
    replaced with just the argument `T` ([#29739]).
