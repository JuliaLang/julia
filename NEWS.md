Julia v1.11 Release Notes
========================

New language features
---------------------
* `public` is a new keyword. Symbols marked with `public` are considered public
  API. Symbols marked with `export` are now also treated as public API. The
  difference between `public` and `export` is that `public` names do not become
  available when `using` a package/module. ([#50105])
* `ScopedValue` implement dynamic scope with inheritance across tasks ([#50958]).
* A new `AbstractString` type, `TaggedString`, is introduced that allows for
  (arbitrary) regional annotations to be attached to an underlying string. This is
  very useful for allowing styling information to be encoded separately, and is
  used extensively in the new `StyledStrings` standard library. There is also a
  new `TaggedChar` type, that is the equivalent new `AbstractChar` type.

Language changes
----------------

Compiler/Runtime improvements
-----------------------------
* Updated GC heuristics to count allocated pages instead of individual objects ([#50144]).
* A new `LazyLibrary` type is exported from `Libdl` for use in building chained lazy library
  loads, primarily to be used within JLLs ([#50074]).

Command-line option changes
---------------------------

* The entry point for Julia has been standardized to `Main.main(ARGS)`. This must be explicitly opted into using the `@main` macro
(see the docstring for further details). When opted-in, and julia is invoked to run a script or expression
(i.e. using `julia script.jl` or `julia -e expr`), julia will subsequently run the `Main.main` function automatically.
This is intended to unify script and compilation workflows, where code loading may happen
in the compiler and execution of `Main.main` may happen in the resulting executable. For interactive use, there is no semantic
difference between defining a `main` function and executing the code directly at the end of the script. ([50974])

Multi-threading changes
-----------------------

Build system changes
--------------------

New library functions
---------------------

* The new `Libc.mkfifo` function wraps the `mkfifo` C function on Unix platforms ([#34587]).
* `hardlink(src, dst)` can be used to create hard links. ([#41639])
* `diskstat(path=pwd())` can be used to return statistics about the disk. ([#42248])
* `copyuntil(out, io, delim)` and `copyline(out, io)` copy data into an `out::IO` stream ([#48273]).
* `eachrsplit(string, pattern)` iterates split substrings right to left.

New library features
--------------------
* `replace(string, pattern...)` now supports an optional `IO` argument to
  write the output to a stream rather than returning a string ([#48625]).

Standard library changes
------------------------

#### StyledStrings

* A new standard library for handling styling in a more comprehensive and structured way.
* The new `Faces` struct serves as a container for text styling information
  (think typeface), and comes with a framework to provide a convenient,
  extensible (via `addface!`), and customisable (with a user's `Faces.toml` and `loadfaces!`) approach to
  styled content.
* The new `@styled_str` string macro provides a convenient way of creating a
  `TaggedString` with various faces or other attributes applied.

#### Package Manager

#### LinearAlgebra

#### Printf

#### Profile

#### Random
* `rand` now supports sampling over `Tuple` types ([#35856], [#50251]).
* `rand` now supports sampling over `Pair` types ([#28705]).
* When seeding RNGs provided by `Random`, negative integer seeds can now be used ([#51416]).
* Seedable random number generators from `Random` can now be seeded by a string, e.g.
  `seed!(rng, "a random seed")` ([#51527]).

#### REPL

* Tab complete hints now show in lighter text while typing in the repl. To disable
  set `Base.active_repl.options.hint_tab_completes = false` ([#51229])

#### SuiteSparse


#### SparseArrays

#### Test

#### Dates

#### Statistics

* Statistics is now an upgradeable standard library.([#46501])

#### Distributed

* `pmap` now defaults to using a `CachingPool` ([#33892]).

#### Unicode


#### DelimitedFiles


#### InteractiveUtils

Deprecated or removed
---------------------


External dependencies
---------------------
* `tput` is no longer called to check terminal capabilities, it has been replaced with a pure-Julia terminfo parser.
