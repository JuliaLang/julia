Julia v1.1.0 Release Notes
==========================

New language features
---------------------

  * An *exception stack* is maintained on each task to make exception handling more robust and enable root cause analysis using `catch_stack` ([#28878]).


Language changes
----------------

  * the constructor `BigFloat(::BigFloat)` now respects the global precision setting and always
    returns a `BigFloat` with precision equal to `precision(BigFloat)` ([#29127]).
  * Parser inputs ending with a comma are now consistently treated as incomplete.
    Previously they were sometimes parsed as tuples, depending on whitespace ([#28506]).
  * `Regex` now behave like a scalar when used in broadcasting ([#29913]).

New library functions
---------------------

  * `splitpath(p::String)` function, which is the opposite of `joinpath(parts...)`: it splits a filepath into its components ([#28156]).
  * `isnothing(::Any)` function, to check whether something is a `Nothing`, returns a `Bool` ([#29679]).

Standard library changes
------------------------

  * `CartesianIndices` can now be constructed from two `CartesianIndex`es `I` and `J` with `I:J` ([#29440]).
  * `copy!` support for arrays, dicts, and sets has been moved to Base from the Future package ([#29173]).
  * Channels now convert inserted values (like containers) instead of requiring types to match ([#29092]).
  * `range` can accept the stop value as a positional argument, e.g. `range(1,10,step=2)` ([#28708]).
  * `edit` can now be called on a module to edit the file that defines it ([#29636]).
  * `diff` now supports arrays of arbitrary dimensionality and can operate over any dimension ([#29827]).

Compiler/Runtime improvements
-----------------------------


Deprecated or removed
---------------------
  * `one(i::CartesianIndex)` should be replaced with `oneunit(i::CartesianIndex)` ([#29442]).
