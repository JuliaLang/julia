Julia v1.13 Release Notes
========================

New language features
---------------------

  - New `Base.@acquire` macro for a non-closure version of `Base.acquire(f, s::Base.Semaphore)`, like `@lock`. ([#56845])
  - More consistent struct introspection methods:
    - `fieldname`, `fieldoffset` and `fieldtype` now all have a plural form returning the information for all fields
    - `fieldoffset` and `fieldtype` now both accept a field index or a field name
    - `fieldindex` and `fieldname` can be used to convert between the field's index and its name
