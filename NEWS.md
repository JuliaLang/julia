Julia v1.14 Release Notes
========================

New language features
---------------------

  - It is now possible to control which version of the Julia syntax will be used to parse a package by setting the
    `compat.julia` or `syntax.julia_version` key in Project.toml. This feature is similar to the notion of "editions"
    in other language ecosystems and will allow non-breaking evolution of Julia syntax in future versions.
    See the "Syntax Versioning" section in the code loading documentation ([#60018]).
  - `ᵅ` (U+U+1D45), `ᵋ` (U+1D4B), `ᶲ` (U+1DB2), `˱` (U+02F1), `˲` (U+02F2), and `ₔ` (U+2094) can now also be used as
    operator suffixes, accessible as `\^alpha`, `\^epsilon`, `\^ltphi`, `\_<`, `\_>`, and `\_schwa` at the REPL
    ([#60285]).
  - The `@label` macro can now create labeled blocks that can be exited early with `break name [value]`. Use
    `@label name expr` for named blocks or `@label _ expr` for anonymous blocks. The `continue` statement also
    supports labels with `continue name` to continue a labeled loop ([#60481]).

Language changes
----------------

Compiler/Runtime improvements
-----------------------------

Command-line option changes
---------------------------

Multi-threading changes
-----------------------

  - New functions `Threads.atomic_fence_heavy` and `Threads.atomic_fence_light` provide support for
    asymmetric atomic fences, speeding up atomic synchronization where one side of the synchronization
    runs significantly less often than the other ([#60311]).

Build system changes
--------------------

New library functions
---------------------

New library features
--------------------

* `IOContext` supports a new boolean `hexunsigned` option that allows for
  printing unsigned integers in decimal instead of hexadecimal ([#60267]).

Standard library changes
------------------------

* `codepoint(c)` now succeeds for overlong encodings.  `Base.ismalformed`, `Base.isoverlong`, and
  `Base.show_invalid` are now `public` and documented (but not exported) ([#55152]).

#### JuliaSyntaxHighlighting

#### LinearAlgebra

#### Markdown

  * Strikethrough text via `~strike~` or `~~through~~` is now supported by the
    Markdown parser. ([#60537])

#### Profile

#### Random

#### REPL

#### Test

* `@test`, `@test_throws`, and `@test_broken` now support a `context` keyword argument
  that provides additional information displayed on test failure. This is useful for
  debugging which specific case failed in parameterized tests ([#60501]).

* `@test_throws`, `@test_warn`, `@test_nowarn`, `@test_logs`, and `@test_deprecated` now support
  `broken` and `skip` keyword arguments for consistency with `@test` ([#60543]).

* New functions `detect_closure_boxes` and `detect_closure_boxes_all` find methods that
  allocate `Core.Box` in their lowered code, which can indicate performance issues from
  captured variables in closures.

#### InteractiveUtils

#### Dates
