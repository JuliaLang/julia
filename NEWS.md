Julia v1.2 Release Notes
========================

New language features
---------------------

  * Argument splatting (`x...`) can now be used in calls to the `new` pseudo-function in
    constructors ([#30577]).

  * Objects created by calling `skipmissing` on an array can now be indexed using indices
    from the parent at non-missing positions. This allows functions such as
    `findall`, `findfirst`, `argmin`/`argmax` and `findmin`/`findmax` to work with these
    objects, returning the index of matching non-missing elements in the parent ([#31008]).

Multi-threading changes
-----------------------

  * The `Condition` type now has a thread-safe replacement, accessed as `Threads.Condition`.
    With that addition, task scheduling primitives such as `ReentrantLock` are now thread-safe ([#30061]).

Language changes
----------------
* Empty entries in `JULIA_DEPOT_PATH` are now expanded to default depot entries ([#31009]).
* `Enum` now behaves like a scalar when used in broadcasting ([#30670]).

Command-line option changes
---------------------------


New library functions
---------------------

* `getipaddrs()` function returns all the IP addresses of the local machine ([#30349])
* Added `Base.hasproperty` and `Base.hasfield` ([#28850]).
* One argument `!=(x)`, `>(x)`, `>=(x)`, `<(x)`, `<=(x)` has been added for currying,
  similar to the existing `==(x)` and `isequal(x)` methods ([#30915]).

Standard library changes
------------------------

* The `extrema` function now accepts a function argument in the same manner as `minimum` and
  `maximum` ([#30323]).
* `hasmethod` can now check for matching keyword argument names ([#30712]).
* `startswith` and `endswith` now accept a `Regex` for the second argument ([#29790]).
* `retry` supports arbitrary callable objects ([#30382]).
* A no-argument construct to `Ptr{T}` has been added which constructs a null pointer ([#30919])

#### LinearAlgebra

* Added keyword arguments `rtol`, `atol` to `pinv` and `nullspace` ([#29998]).
* `UniformScaling` instances are now callable such that e.g. `I(3)` will produce a `Diagonal` matrix ([#30298]).
* Eigenvalues λ of general matrices are now sorted lexicographically by (Re λ, Im λ) ([#21598]).
* `one` for structured matrices (`Diagonal`, `Bidiagonal`, `Tridiagonal`, `Symtridiagonal`) now preserves
  structure and type. ([#29777])
* `diagm(v)` is now a shorthand for `diagm(0 => v)`. ([#31125]).

#### SparseArrays

* performance improvements for sparse matrix-matrix multiplication ([#30372]).
* Sparse vector outer products are more performant and maintain sparsity in products of the
  form `kron(u, v')`, `u * v'`, and `u .* v'` where `u` and `v` are sparse vectors or column
  views. ([#24980])

#### Dates

* Fixed `repr` such that it displays `DateTime` as it would be entered in Julia ([#30200]).

#### Miscellaneous

* Since environment variables on Windows are case-insensitive, `ENV` now converts its keys
  to uppercase for display, iteration, and copying ([#30593]).

External dependencies
---------------------

* libgit2 has been updated to v0.27.7 ([#30584]).
* OpenBLAS has been updated to v0.3.5 ([#30583]).
* MbedTLS has been updated to v2.16.0 ([#30618]).
* libunwind has been updated to v1.3.1 ([#30724]).

Deprecated or removed
---------------------
