Julia v1.5 Release Notes
========================

New language features
---------------------


Language changes
----------------

* Converting arbitrary tuples to `NTuple`, e.g. `convert(NTuple, (1, ""))` now gives an error,
  where it used to be incorrectly allowed. This is because `NTuple` refers only to homogeneous
  tuples (this meaning has not changed) ([#34272]).

* The interactive REPL now uses "soft scope" for top-level expressions: an assignment inside a
  scope block such as a `for` loop automatically assigns to a global variable if one has been
  defined already. This matches the behavior of Julia versions 0.6 and prior, as well as
  [IJulia](https://github.com/JuliaLang/IJulia.jl).
  Note that this only affects expressions interactively typed or pasted directly into the
  default REPL.

Multi-threading changes
-----------------------


Build system changes
--------------------


New library functions

New library features
--------------------
* Function composition now works also on one argument `âˆ˜(f) = f` (#34251)


Standard library changes
------------------------
* The `@timed` macro now returns a `NamedTuple` ([#34149])

#### LinearAlgebra
* The BLAS submodule now supports the level-2 BLAS subroutine `hpmv!` ([#34211]).
* `normalize` now supports multidimensional arrays ([#34239])
* `lq` factorizations can now be used to compute the minimum-norm solution to under-determined systems ([#34350]).
