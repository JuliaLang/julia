Julia v1.6 Release Notes
========================

New language features
---------------------

* Types written with `where` syntax can now be used to define constructors, e.g.
  `(Foo{T} where T)(x) = ...`.

Language changes
----------------

* Broadcasting (dot-call) syntax can now be used with `do` blocks ([#36156]).

Compiler/Runtime improvements
-----------------------------

* All platforms can now use `@executable_path` within `jl_load_dynamic_library()`.
  This allows executable-relative paths to be embedded within executables on all
  platforms, not just MacOS, which the syntax is borrowed from. ([#35627])

Command-line option changes
---------------------------


Multi-threading changes
-----------------------


Build system changes
--------------------


New library functions
---------------------

* New function `Base.kron!` and corresponding overloads for various matrix types for performing Kronecker product in-place. ([#31069]).
* New function `Base.Threads.foreach(f, channel::Channel)` for multithreaded `Channel` consumption. ([#34543]).

New library features
--------------------


Standard library changes
------------------------

* The `nextprod` function now accepts tuples and other array types for its first argument ([#35791]).
* The function `isapprox(x,y)` now accepts the `norm` keyword argument also for numeric (i.e., non-array) arguments `x` and `y` ([#35883]).
* `view`, `@view`, and `@views` now work on `AbstractString`s, returning a `SubString` when appropriate ([#35879]).
* All `AbstractUnitRange{<:Integer}`s now work with `SubString`, `view`, `@view` and `@views` on strings ([#35879]).

#### LinearAlgebra
* New method `LinearAlgebra.issuccess(::CholeskyPivoted)` for checking whether pivoted Cholesky factorization was successful ([#36002]).
* `UniformScaling` can now be indexed into using ranges to return dense matrices and vectors ([#24359]).

#### Markdown


#### Random


#### REPL

* The `AbstractMenu` extension interface of `REPL.TerminalMenus` has been extensively
  overhauled. The new interface does not rely on global configuration variables, is more
  consistent in delegating printing of the navigation/selection markers, and provides
  improved support for dynamic menus.  These changes are compatible with the previous
  (deprecated) interface, so are non-breaking.

#### SparseArrays

* Display large sparse matrices with a Unicode "spy" plot of their nonzero patterns, and display small sparse matrices by an `Matrix`-like 2d layout of their contents.

#### Dates


#### Statistics


#### Sockets


#### Distributed


#### UUIDs
* Change `uuid1` and `uuid4` to use `Random.RandomDevice()` as default random number generator ([#35872]).
* Added `parse(::Type{UUID}, ::AbstractString)` method

Deprecated or removed
