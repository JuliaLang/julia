New library features
--------------------
* The `initialized=true` keyword assignment for `sortperm!` and `partialsortperm!`
  is now a no-op ([#47979]). It previously exposed unsafe behavior ([#47977]).
* `binomial(x, k)` now supports non-integer `x` ([#48124]).
* A `CartesianIndex` is now treated as a "scalar" for broadcasting ([#47044]).

Standard library changes
------------------------

#### Package Manager

- "Package Extensions": support for loading a piece of code based on other
  packages being loaded in the Julia session.
  This has similar applications as the Requires.jl package but also
  supports precompilation and setting compatibility.

#### LinearAlgebra

- `AbstractQ` no longer subtypes to `AbstractMatrix`. Moreover, `adjoint(Q::AbstractQ)`
  no longer wraps `Q` in an `Adjoint` type, but instead in an `AdjointQ`, that itself
  subtypes `AbstractQ`. This change accounts for the fact that typically `AbstractQ`
  instances behave like function-based, matrix-backed linear operators, and hence don't
  allow for efficient indexing. Also, many `AbstractQ` types can act on vectors/matrices
  of different size, acting like a matrix with context-dependent size. With this change,
  `AbstractQ` has a well-defined API that is described in detail in the
  [Julia documentation](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/stdlib/LinearAlgebra/#man-linalg-abstractq)
  ([#46196]).

#### Printf
* Format specifiers now support dynamic width and precision, e.g. `%*s` and `%*.*g` ([#40105]).

#### Profile


#### Random


#### REPL


#### SuiteSparse


#### SparseArrays


#### Test


* The `@test_broken` macro (or `@test` with `broken=true`) now complains if the test expression returns a
  non-boolean value in the same way as a non-broken test. ([#47804])

#### Dates


#### Distributed


#### Unicode


#### DelimitedFiles


#### InteractiveUtils

 * `code_native` and `@code_native` now default to intel syntax instead of AT&T.
