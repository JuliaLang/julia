Julia v1.2 Release Notes
========================

New language features
---------------------

* The `extrema` function now accepts a function argument in the same manner as `minimum` and
  `maximum` ([#30323]).
* There are new method overloads `unsigned(T::Type)` and `signed(T::Type)` that accept a `Type`,
  and return its corresponding signed/unsigned equivalent type ([#30445]).

Multi-threading changes
-----------------------

  * The `Condition` type now has a thread-safe replacement, accessed as `Threads.Condition`.
    With that addition, task scheduling primitives such as `ReentrantLock` are now thread-safe ([#30061]).
