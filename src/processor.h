/**
 * Related sysimg exported symbols
 *
 * In the following text function refer to an abstract identity.
 * It corresponds to a `Function` that we emit in the codegen and there might be multiple copy
 * of it in the system image. Only one of those copy will be used in a given session.
 * Function pointers refer to a real piece of code in the system image.
 * Each function might have multiple function pointers in the system image
 * and each function pointer will correspond to only one function.
 *
 * # Global function and base pointers
 * `jl_sysimg_gvars_base`:
 *     The address of this symbol is the base data pointer
 *     (all other data pointers are stored as offsets to this address)
 * `jl_sysimg_fvars_base`:
 *     The address of this symbol is the base function pointer
 *     (all other function pointers are stored as offsets to this address)
 * `jl_sysimg_fvars_offsets`: [static data]
 *     The array of function pointer offsets (`int32_t`) from the base pointer.
 *     This includes all julia functions in sysimg as well as all other functions that are cloned.
 *     The default function pointer is used if the function is cloned.
 *     The first element is the size of the array, which should **NOT** be used as the number
 *     of julia functions in the sysimg.
 *     Each entry in this array uniquely identifies a function which we are interested in
 *     (the function may have multiple function pointers corresponding to different versions).
 *     In other sysimg info, all information of functions are stored as function index which are
 *     `uint32_t` index in this array.
 *
 * # Target data and dispatch slots (Only needed by runtime during loading)
 * `jl_dispatch_target_ids`: [static data] serialize target data.
 *     This contains the number of targets which is needed to decode `jl_dispatch_fvars_idxs`
 *     in additional to the name and feature set of each target.
 * `jl_dispatch_reloc_slots`: [static data] location and index of relocation slots.
 *     Stored as pairs of function indices and `int32_t` offsets from `jl_sysimg_gvars_base`.
 *     The first element is an `uint32_t` giving the number of relocations.
 *     This is needed for functions whose address is used in a way that requires dispatch.
 *     We currently only support one type of relocation (i.e. absolute pointer) which is enough
 *     for all use in functions as well as global GOT slot (for "PLT" callback).
 *     Note that not all functions being cloned are assigned a slot.
 *     This array is sorted by the function indices.
 *     There can be more than one slot per-function,
 *     i.e. there can be duplicated function indices.
 *
 * # Target functions
 * `jl_dispatch_fvars_idxs`: [static data] Target specific functions indices.
 *     For each target, this includes a tagged `uint32_t` length, an optional `uint32_t` index
 *     of the base target followed by an array of tagged function indices.
 *     The base target index is required to be smaller than the index of the current target
 *     and must be the default (`0`) or a `clone_all` target.
 *     If it's not `0`, the function pointer array for the `clone_all` target will be used as
 *     the base function pointer offsets instead.
 *     The tag bits for both the length and the indices are the top bit.
 *     A tagged length indicates that all of the functions are cloned and the indices follows
 *     are the ones that requires relocation. The base target index is omitted in this case.
 *     Otherwise, the length is the total number of functions that we are interested in
 *     for this target, which includes all cloned julia functions and
 *     all other cloned functions that requires relocation.
 *     A tagged index means that the function pointer should be filled into the GOT slots
 *     identified by `jl_dispatch_reloc_slots`. There could be more than one slot per function.
 *     (Note that a tagged index could corresponds to a functions pointer that's the same as
 *     the base one since this is the only way we currently represent relocations.)
 *     A tagged length implicitly tags all the indices and the indices will not have the tag bit
 *     set. The lengths in this variable is needed to decode `jl_dispatch_fvars_offsets`.
 * `jl_dispatch_fvars_offsets`: [static data] Target specific function pointer offsets.
 *     This contains all the cloned functions that we are interested and it needs to be decoded
 *     and used along with `jl_dispatch_fvars_idxs`.
 *     For the default target, there's no entries in this variable, if there's any relocations
 *     needed for the default target, the function pointers are taken from the global offset
 *     arrays directly.
 *     For a `clone_all` target (i.e. with the length in `jl_dispatch_fvars_idxs` tagged), this
 *     variable contains an offset array the same length as the global one. Only the indices
 *     appeared in `jl_dispatch_fvars_idxs` needs relocation and the dispatch code should return
 *     this array as the original/base function offsets.
 *     For other targets, this variable contains an offset array with the length defined in
 *     `jl_dispatch_fvars_idxs`. Tagged indices needs relocations.
