  With memory streams, mixed reads and writes are equivalent to performing
  sequences of *p++, as either an lvalue or rvalue. File streams behave
  similarly, but other streams might not support this. Using unbuffered
  mode makes this more predictable.

  Note on "unget" functions:
  There are two kinds of functions here: those that operate on sized
  blocks of bytes and those that operate on logical units like "character"
  or "integer". The "unget" functions only work on logical units. There
  is no "unget n bytes". You can only do an unget after a matching get.
  However, data pushed back by an unget is available to all read operations.
  The reason for this is that unget is defined in terms of its effect on
  the underlying buffer (namely, it rebuffers data as if it had been
  buffered but not read yet). IOS reserves the right to perform large block
  operations directly, bypassing the buffer. In such a case data was
  never buffered, so "rebuffering" has no meaning (i.e. there is no
  correspondence between the buffer and the physical stream).

  Single-bit I/O is able to write partial bytes ONLY IF the stream supports
  seeking. Also, line buffering is not well-defined in the context of
  single-bit I/O, so it might not do what you expect.

  implementation notes:
  in order to know where we are in a file, we must ensure the buffer
  is only populated from the underlying stream starting with p==buf.

  to switch from writing to reading: flush, set p=buf, cnt=0
  to switch from reading to writing: seek backwards cnt bytes, p=buf, cnt=0

  when writing: buf starts at curr. physical stream pos, p - buf is how
  many bytes we've written logically. cnt==0

  dirty == (bitpos>0 && state==iost_wr), EXCEPT right after switching from
  reading to writing, where we might be in the middle of a byte without
  having changed it.

  to write a bit: if !dirty, read up to maxsize-(p-buf) into buffer, then
  seek back by the same amount (undo it). write onto those bits. now set
  the dirty bit. in this state, we can bit-read up to the end of the byte,
  then formally switch to the read state using flush.

  design points:
  - data-source independence, including memory streams
  - expose buffer to user, allow user-owned buffers
  - allow direct I/O, don't always go through buffer
  - buffer-internal seeking. makes seeking back 1-2 bytes very fast,
    and makes it possible for sockets where it otherwise wouldn't be
  - tries to allow switching between reading and writing
  - support 64-bit and large files
  - efficient, low-latency buffering
  - special support for utf8
  - type-aware functions with byte-order swapping service
  - position counter for meaningful data offsets with sockets

  theory of operation:

  the buffer is a view of part of a file/stream. you can seek, read, and
  write around in it as much as you like, as if it were just a string.

  we keep track of the part of the buffer that's invalid (written to).
  we remember whether the position of the underlying stream is aligned
  with the end of the buffer (reading mode) or the beginning (writing mode).

  based on this info, we might have to seek back before doing a flush.

  as optimizations, we do no writing if the buffer isn't "dirty", and we
  do no reading if the data will only be overwritten.
