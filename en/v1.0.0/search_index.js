    "text": "Scientific computing has traditionally required the highest performance, yet domain experts have largely moved to slower dynamic languages for daily work. We believe there are many good reasons to prefer dynamic languages for these applications, and we do not expect their use to diminish. Fortunately, modern language design and compiler techniques make it possible to mostly eliminate the performance trade-off and provide a single environment productive enough for prototyping and efficient enough for deploying performance-intensive applications. The Julia programming language fills this role: it is a flexible dynamic language, appropriate for scientific and numerical computing, with performance comparable to traditional statically-typed languages.Because Julia\'s compiler is different from the interpreters used for languages like Python or R, you may find that Julia\'s performance is unintuitive at first. If you find that something is slow, we highly recommend reading through the Performance Tips section before trying anything else. Once you understand how Julia works, it\'s easy to write code that\'s nearly as fast as C.Julia features optional typing, multiple dispatch, and good performance, achieved using type inference and just-in-time (JIT) compilation, implemented using LLVM. It is multi-paradigm, combining features of imperative, functional, and object-oriented programming. Julia provides ease and expressiveness for high-level numerical computing, in the same way as languages such as R, MATLAB, and Python, but also supports general programming. To achieve this, Julia builds upon the lineage of mathematical programming languages, but also borrows much from popular dynamic languages, including Lisp, Perl, Python, Lua, and Ruby.The most significant departures of Julia from typical dynamic languages are:The core language imposes very little; Julia Base and the standard library is written in Julia itself, including primitive operations like integer arithmetic\nA rich language of types for constructing and describing objects, that can also optionally be used to make type declarations\nThe ability to define function behavior across many combinations of argument types via multiple dispatch\nAutomatic generation of efficient, specialized code for different argument types\nGood performance, approaching that of statically-compiled languages like CAlthough one sometimes speaks of dynamic languages as being \"typeless\", they are definitely not: every object, whether primitive or user-defined, has a type. The lack of type declarations in most dynamic languages, however, means that one cannot instruct the compiler about the types of values, and often cannot explicitly talk about types at all. In static languages, on the other hand, while one can – and usually must – annotate types for the compiler, types exist only at compile time and cannot be manipulated or expressed at run time. In Julia, types are themselves run-time objects, and can also be used to convey information to the compiler.While the casual programmer need not explicitly use types or multiple dispatch, they are the core unifying features of Julia: functions are defined on different combinations of argument types, and applied by dispatching to the most specific matching definition. This model is a good fit for mathematical programming, where it is unnatural for the first argument to \"own\" an operation as in traditional object-oriented dispatch. Operators are just functions with special notation – to extend addition to new user-defined data types, you define new methods for the + function. Existing code then seamlessly applies to the new data types.Partly because of run-time type inference (augmented by optional type annotations), and partly because of a strong focus on performance from the inception of the project, Julia\'s computational efficiency exceeds that of other dynamic languages, and even rivals that of statically-compiled languages. For large scale numerical problems, speed always has been, continues to be, and probably always will be crucial: the amount of data being processed has easily kept pace with Moore\'s Law over the past decades.Julia aims to create an unprecedented combination of ease-of-use, power, and efficiency in a single language. In addition to the above, some advantages of Julia over comparable systems include:Free and open source (MIT licensed)\nUser-defined types are as fast and compact as built-ins\nNo need to vectorize code for performance; devectorized code is fast\nDesigned for parallelism and distributed computation\nLightweight \"green\" threading (coroutines)\nUnobtrusive yet powerful type system\nElegant and extensible conversions and promotions for numeric and other types\nEfficient support for Unicode, including but not limited to UTF-8\nCall C functions directly (no wrappers or special APIs needed)\nPowerful shell-like capabilities for managing other processes\nLisp-like macros and other metaprogramming facilities"

    "text": "Julia installation is straightforward, whether using precompiled binaries or compiling from source. Download and install Julia by following the instructions at https://julialang.org/downloads/.The easiest way to learn and experiment with Julia is by starting an interactive session (also known as a read-eval-print loop or \"REPL\") by double-clicking the Julia executable or running julia from the command line:io = IOBuffer()\nBase.banner(io)\nbanner = String(take!(io))\nimport Markdown\nMarkdown.parse(\"```\\n\\$ julia\\n\\n$(banner)\\njulia> 1 + 2\\n3\\n\\njulia> ans\\n3\\n```\")To exit the interactive session, type CTRL-D (press the Control/^ key together with the d key), or type exit(). When run in interactive mode, julia displays a banner and prompts the user for input. Once the user has entered a complete expression, such as 1 + 2, and hits enter, the interactive session evaluates the expression and shows its value. If an expression is entered into an interactive session with a trailing semicolon, its value is not shown. The variable ans is bound to the value of the last evaluated expression whether it is shown or not. The ans variable is only bound in interactive sessions, not when Julia code is run in other ways.To evaluate expressions written in a source file file.jl, write include(\"file.jl\").To run code in a file non-interactively, you can give it as the first argument to the julia command:$ julia script.jl arg1 arg2...As the example implies, the following command-line arguments to julia are interpreted as command-line arguments to the program script.jl, passed in the global constant ARGS. The name of the script itself is passed in as the global PROGRAM_FILE. Note that ARGS is also set when a Julia expression is given using the -e option on the command line (see the julia help output below) but PROGRAM_FILE will be empty. For example, to just print the arguments given to a script, you could do this:$ julia -e \'println(PROGRAM_FILE); for x in ARGS; println(x); end\' foo bar\n\nfoo\nbarOr you could put that code into a script and run it:$ echo \'println(PROGRAM_FILE); for x in ARGS; println(x); end\' > script.jl\n$ julia script.jl foo bar\nscript.jl\nfoo\nbarThe -- delimiter can be used to separate command-line arguments intended for the script file from arguments intended for Julia:$ julia --color=yes -O -- foo.jl arg1 arg2..Julia can be started in parallel mode with either the -p or the --machine-file options. -p n will launch an additional n worker processes, while --machine-file file will launch a worker for each line in file file. The machines defined in file must be accessible via a password-less ssh login, with Julia installed at the same location as the current host. Each machine definition takes the form [count*][user@]host[:port] [bind_addr[:port]]. user defaults to current user, port to the standard ssh port. count is the number of workers to spawn on the node, and defaults to 1. The optional bind-to bind_addr[:port] specifies the IP address and port that other workers should use to connect to this worker.If you have code that you want executed whenever Julia is run, you can put it in ~/.julia/config/startup.jl:$ echo \'println(\"Greetings! 你好! 안녕하세요?\")\' > ~/.julia/config/startup.jl\n$ julia\nGreetings! 你好! 안녕하세요?\n\n...There are various ways to run Julia code and provide options, similar to those available for the perl and ruby programs:julia [switches] -- [programfile] [args...]Switch Description\n-v, --version Display version information\n-h, --help Print this message\n-J, --sysimage <file> Start up with the given system image file\n-H, --home <dir> Set location of julia executable\n--startup-file={yes|no} Load ~/.julia/config/startup.jl\n--handle-signals={yes|no} Enable or disable Julia\'s default signal handlers\n--sysimage-native-code={yes|no} Use native code from system image if available\n--compiled-modules={yes|no} Enable or disable incremental precompilation of modules\n-e, --eval <expr> Evaluate <expr>\n-E, --print <expr> Evaluate <expr> and display the result\n-L, --load <file> Load <file> immediately on all processors\n-p, --procs {N|auto} Integer value N launches N additional local worker processes; auto launches as many workers as the number of local CPU threads (logical cores)\n--machine-file <file> Run processes on hosts listed in <file>\n-i Interactive mode; REPL runs and isinteractive() is true\n-q, --quiet Quiet startup: no banner, suppress REPL warnings\n--banner={yes|no|auto} Enable or disable startup banner\n--color={yes|no|auto} Enable or disable color text\n--history-file={yes|no} Load or save history\n--depwarn={yes|no|error} Enable or disable syntax and method deprecation warnings (error turns warnings into errors)\n--warn-overwrite={yes|no} Enable or disable method overwrite warnings\n-C, --cpu-target <target> Limit usage of cpu features up to <target>; set to help to see the available options\n-O, --optimize={0,1,2,3} Set the optimization level (default level is 2 if unspecified or 3 if used without a level)\n-g, -g <level> Enable / Set the level of debug info generation (default level is 1 if unspecified or 2 if used without a level)\n--inline={yes|no} Control whether inlining is permitted, including overriding @inline declarations\n--check-bounds={yes|no} Emit bounds checks always or never (ignoring declarations)\n--math-mode={ieee,fast} Disallow or enable unsafe floating point optimizations (overrides @fastmath declaration)\n--code-coverage={none|user|all} Count executions of source lines\n--code-coverage equivalent to --code-coverage=user\n--track-allocation={none|user|all} Count bytes allocated by each source line\n--track-allocation equivalent to --track-allocation=user"

    "text": "A variable, in Julia, is a name associated (or bound) to a value. It\'s useful when you want to store a value (that you obtained after some math, for example) for later use.

(If you find a symbol somewhere, e.g. in someone else\'s code, that you don\'t know how to type, the REPL help will tell you: just type ? and then paste the symbol.)Julia will even let you redefine built-in constants and functions if needed (although this is not recommended to avoid potential confusions):julia> pi = 3\n3\n\njulia> pi\n3\n\njulia> sqrt = 4\n4However, if you try to redefine a built-in constant or function already in use, Julia will give you an error:julia> pi\nπ = 3.1415926535897...\n\njulia> pi = 3\nERROR: cannot assign variable MathConstants.pi from module Main\n\njulia> sqrt(100)\n10.0\n\njulia> sqrt = 4\nERROR: cannot assign variable Base.sqrt from module Main"

    "text": "Variable names must begin with a letter (A-Z or a-z), underscore, or a subset of Unicode code points greater than 00A0; in particular, Unicode character categories Lu/Ll/Lt/Lm/Lo/Nl (letters), Sc/So (currency and other symbols), and a few other letter-like characters (e.g. a subset of the Sm math symbols) are allowed. Subsequent characters may also include ! and digits (0-9 and other characters in categories Nd/No), as well as other Unicode code points: diacritics and other modifying marks (categories Mn/Mc/Me/Sk), some punctuation connectors (category Pc), primes, and a few other characters.Operators like + are also valid identifiers, but are parsed specially. In some contexts, operators can be used just like variables; for example (+) refers to the addition function, and (+) = f will reassign it. Most of the Unicode infix operators (in category Sm), such as ⊕, are parsed as infix operators and are available for user-defined methods (e.g. you can use const ⊗ = kron to define ⊗ as an infix Kronecker product).  Operators can also be suffixed with modifying marks, primes, and sub/superscripts, e.g. +̂ₐ″ is parsed as an infix operator with the same precedence as +.The only explicitly disallowed names for variables are the names of built-in statements:julia> else = false\nERROR: syntax: unexpected \"else\"\n\njulia> try = \"No\"\nERROR: syntax: unexpected \"=\"Some Unicode characters are considered to be equivalent in identifiers. Different ways of entering Unicode combining characters (e.g., accents) are treated as equivalent (specifically, Julia identifiers are NFC-normalized). The Unicode characters ɛ (U+025B: Latin small letter open e) and µ (U+00B5: micro sign) are treated as equivalent to the corresponding Greek letters, because the former are easily accessible via some input methods."

    "text": "Integers and floating-point values are the basic building blocks of arithmetic and computation. Built-in representations of such values are called numeric primitives, while representations of integers and floating-point numbers as immediate values in code are known as numeric literals. For example, 1 is an integer literal, while 1.0 is a floating-point literal; their binary in-memory representations as objects are numeric primitives.Julia provides a broad range of primitive numeric types, and a full complement of arithmetic and bitwise operators as well as standard mathematical functions are defined over them. These map directly onto numeric types and operations that are natively supported on modern computers, thus allowing Julia to take full advantage of computational resources. Additionally, Julia provides software support for Arbitrary Precision Arithmetic, which can handle operations on numeric values that cannot be represented effectively in native hardware representations, but at the cost of relatively slower performance.The following are Julia\'s primitive numeric types:Integer types:Type Signed? Number of bits Smallest value Largest value\nInt8 ✓ 8 -2^7 2^7 - 1\nUInt8  8 0 2^8 - 1\nInt16 ✓ 16 -2^15 2^15 - 1\nUInt16  16 0 2^16 - 1\nInt32 ✓ 32 -2^31 2^31 - 1\nUInt32  32 0 2^32 - 1\nInt64 ✓ 64 -2^63 2^63 - 1\nUInt64  64 0 2^64 - 1\nInt128 ✓ 128 -2^127 2^127 - 1\nUInt128  128 0 2^128 - 1\nBool N/A 8 false (0) true (1)Floating-point types:Type Precision Number of bits\nFloat16 half 16\nFloat32 single 32\nFloat64 double 64Additionally, full support for Complex and Rational Numbers is built on top of these primitive numeric types.

This does not occur when Julia code is run in other ways.Binary and octal literals are also supported:julia> 0b10\n0x02\n\njulia> typeof(ans)\nUInt8\n\njulia> 0o010\n0x08\n\njulia> typeof(ans)\nUInt8\n\njulia> 0x00000000000000001111222233334444\n0x00000000000000001111222233334444\n\njulia> typeof(ans)\nUInt128As for hexadecimal literals, binary and octal literals produce unsigned integer types. The size of the binary data item is the minimal needed size, if the leading digit of the literal is not 0. In the case of leading zeros, the size is determined by the minimal needed size for a literal, which has the same length but leading digit 1. That allows the user to control the size. Values, which cannot be stored in UInt128 cannot be written as such literals.Binary, octal, and hexadecimal literals may be signed by a - immediately preceding the unsigned literal. They produce an unsigned integer of the same size as the unsigned literal would do, with the two\'s complement of the value:julia> -0x2\n0xfe\n\njulia> -0x0002\n0xfffeThe minimum and maximum representable values of primitive numeric types such as integers are given by the typemin and typemax functions:julia> (typemin(Int32), typemax(Int32))\n(-2147483648, 2147483647)\n\njulia> for T in [Int8,Int16,Int32,Int64,Int128,UInt8,UInt16,UInt32,UInt64,UInt128]\n           println(\"$(lpad(T,7)): [$(typemin(T)),$(typemax(T))]\")\n       end\n   Int8: [-128,127]\n  Int16: [-32768,32767]\n  Int32: [-2147483648,2147483647]\n  Int64: [-9223372036854775808,9223372036854775807]\n Int128: [-170141183460469231731687303715884105728,170141183460469231731687303715884105727]\n  UInt8: [0,255]\n UInt16: [0,65535]\n UInt32: [0,4294967295]\n UInt64: [0,18446744073709551615]\nUInt128: [0,340282366920938463463374607431768211455]The values returned by typemin and typemax are always of the given argument type.

    "text": "Most real numbers cannot be represented exactly with floating-point numbers, and so for many purposes it is important to know the distance between two adjacent representable floating-point numbers, which is often known as machine epsilon.Julia provides eps, which gives the distance between 1.0 and the next larger representable floating-point value:julia> eps(Float32)\n1.1920929f-7\n\njulia> eps(Float64)\n2.220446049250313e-16\n\njulia> eps() # same as eps(Float64)\n2.220446049250313e-16These values are 2.0^-23 and 2.0^-52 as Float32 and Float64 values, respectively. The eps function can also take a floating-point value as an argument, and gives the absolute difference between that value and the next representable floating point value. That is, eps(x) yields a value of the same type as x such that x + eps(x) is the next representable floating-point value larger than x:julia> eps(1.0)\n2.220446049250313e-16\n\njulia> eps(1000.)\n1.1368683772161603e-13\n\njulia> eps(1e-27)\n1.793662034335766e-43\n\njulia> eps(0.0)\n5.0e-324The distance between two adjacent representable floating-point numbers is not constant, but is smaller for smaller values and larger for larger values. In other words, the representable floating-point numbers are densest in the real number line near zero, and grow sparser exponentially as one moves farther away from zero. By definition, eps(1.0) is the same as eps(Float64) since 1.0 is a 64-bit floating-point value.Julia also provides the nextfloat and prevfloat functions which return the next largest or smallest representable floating-point number to the argument respectively:julia> x = 1.25f0\n1.25f0\n\njulia> nextfloat(x)\n1.2500001f0\n\njulia> prevfloat(x)\n1.2499999f0\n\njulia> bitstring(prevfloat(x))\n\"00111111100111111111111111111111\"\n\njulia> bitstring(x)\n\"00111111101000000000000000000000\"\n\njulia> bitstring(nextfloat(x))\n\"00111111101000000000000000000001\"This example highlights the general principle that the adjacent representable floating-point numbers also have adjacent binary integer representations."

So -2x is parsed as (-2) * x and √2x is parsed as (√2) * x. However, numeric literal coefficients parse similarly to unary operators when combined with exponentiation. For example 2^3x is parsed as 2^(3x), and 2x^3 is parsed as 2*(x^3).Numeric literals also work as coefficients to parenthesized expressions:julia> 2(x-1)^2 - 3(x-1) + 1\n3note: Note\nThe precedence of numeric literal coefficients used for implicit multiplication is higher than other binary operators such as multiplication (*), and division (/, \\, and //).  This means, for example, that 1 / 2im equals -0.5im and 6 // 2(2 + 1) equals 1 // 1.Additionally, parenthesized expressions can be used as coefficients to variables, implying multiplication of the expression by the variable:julia> (x-1)x\n6Neither juxtaposition of two parenthesized expressions, nor placing a variable before a parenthesized expression, however, can be used to imply multiplication:julia> (x-1)(x+1)\nERROR: MethodError: objects of type Int64 are not callable\n\njulia> x(x+1)\nERROR: MethodError: objects of type Int64 are not callableBoth expressions are interpreted as function application: any expression that is not a numeric literal, when immediately followed by a parenthetical, is interpreted as a function applied to the values in parentheses (see Functions for more about functions). Thus, in both of these cases, an error occurs since the left-hand value is not a function.The above syntactic enhancements significantly reduce the visual noise incurred when writing common mathematical formulae. Note that no whitespace may come between a numeric literal coefficient and the identifier or parenthesized expression which it multiplies."

Moreover, like all vectorized \"dot calls,\" these \"dot operators\" are fusing. For example, if you compute 2 .* A.^2 .+ sin.(A) (or equivalently @. 2A^2 + sin(A), using the @. macro) for an array A, it performs a single loop over A, computing 2a^2 + sin(a) for each element of A. In particular, nested dot calls like f.(g.(x)) are fused, and \"adjacent\" binary operators like x .+ 3 .* x.^2 are equivalent to nested dot calls (+).(x, (*).(3, (^).(x, 2))).Furthermore, \"dotted\" updating operators like a .+= b (or @. a += b) are parsed as a .= a .+ b, where .= is a fused in-place assignment operation (see the dot syntax documentation).Note the dot syntax is also applicable to user-defined operators. For example, if you define ⊗(A,B) = kron(A,B) to give a convenient infix syntax A ⊗ B for Kronecker products (kron), then [A,B] .⊗ [C,D] will compute [A⊗C, B⊗D] with no additional coding.Combining dot operators with numeric literals can be ambiguous. For example, it is not clear whether 1.+x means 1. + x or 1 .+ x. Therefore this syntax is disallowed, and spaces must be used around the operator in such cases."

    "text": "Strings are finite sequences of characters. Of course, the real trouble comes when one asks what a character is. The characters that English speakers are familiar with are the letters A, B, C, etc., together with numerals and common punctuation symbols. These characters are standardized together with a mapping to integer values between 0 and 127 by the ASCII standard. There are, of course, many other characters used in non-English languages, including variants of the ASCII characters with accents and other modifications, related scripts such as Cyrillic and Greek, and scripts completely unrelated to ASCII and English, including Arabic, Chinese, Hebrew, Hindi, Japanese, and Korean. The Unicode standard tackles the complexities of what exactly a character is, and is generally accepted as the definitive standard addressing this problem. Depending on your needs, you can either ignore these complexities entirely and just pretend that only ASCII characters exist, or you can write code that can handle any of the characters or encodings that one may encounter when handling non-ASCII text. Julia makes dealing with plain ASCII text simple and efficient, and handling Unicode is as simple and efficient as possible. In particular, you can write C-style string code to process ASCII strings, and they will work as expected, both in terms of performance and semantics. If such code encounters non-ASCII text, it will gracefully fail with a clear error message, rather than silently introducing corrupt results. When this happens, modifying the code to handle non-ASCII data is straightforward.There are a few noteworthy high-level features about Julia\'s strings:The built-in concrete type used for strings (and string literals) in Julia is String. This supports the full range of Unicode characters via the UTF-8 encoding. (A transcode function is provided to convert to/from other Unicode encodings.)\nAll string types are subtypes of the abstract type AbstractString, and external packages define additional AbstractString subtypes (e.g. for other encodings).  If you define a function expecting a string argument, you should declare the type as AbstractString in order to accept any string type.\nLike C and Java, but unlike most dynamic languages, Julia has a first-class type for representing a single character, called AbstractChar. The built-in Char subtype of AbstractChar is a 32-bit primitive type that can represent any Unicode character (and which is based on the UTF-8 encoding).\nAs in Java, strings are immutable: the value of an AbstractString object cannot be changed. To construct a different string value, you construct a new string from parts of other strings.\nConceptually, a string is a partial function from indices to characters: for some index values, no character value is returned, and instead an exception is thrown. This allows for efficient indexing into strings by the byte index of an encoded representation rather than by a character index, which cannot be implemented both efficiently and simply for variable-width encodings of Unicode strings."

The keyword end can be used inside an indexing operation as shorthand for the last index along the given dimension. Most indexing in Julia is 1-based: the first element of many integer-indexed objects is found at index 1.

Alternatively, it is possible to create a view into a string using the type SubString, for example:julia> str = \"long string\"\n\"long string\"\n\njulia> substr = SubString(str, 1, 4)\n\"long\"\n\njulia> typeof(substr)\nSubString{String}Several standard functions like chop, chomp or strip return a SubString."

    "text": "Julia fully supports Unicode characters and strings. As discussed above, in character literals, Unicode code points can be represented using Unicode \\u and \\U escape sequences, as well as all the standard C escape sequences. These can likewise be used to write string literals:julia> s = \"\\u2200 x \\u2203 y\"\n\"∀ x ∃ y\"Whether these Unicode characters are displayed as escapes or shown as special characters depends on your terminal\'s locale settings and its support for Unicode. String literals are encoded using the UTF-8 encoding. UTF-8 is a variable-width encoding, meaning that not all characters are encoded in the same number of bytes. In UTF-8, ASCII characters – i.e. those with code points less than 0x80 (128) – are encoded as they are in ASCII, using a single byte, while code points 0x80 and above are encoded using multiple bytes – up to four per character. This means that not every byte index into a UTF-8 string is necessarily a valid index for a character. If you index into a string at such an invalid byte index, an error is thrown:julia> s[1]\n\'∀\': Unicode U+2200 (category Sm: Symbol, math)\n\njulia> s[2]\nERROR: StringIndexError(\"∀ x ∃ y\", 2)\n[...]\n\njulia> s[3]\nERROR: StringIndexError(\"∀ x ∃ y\", 3)\nStacktrace:\n[...]\n\njulia> s[4]\n\' \': ASCII/Unicode U+0020 (category Zs: Separator, space)In this case, the character ∀ is a three-byte character, so the indices 2 and 3 are invalid and the next character\'s index is 4; this next valid index can be computed by nextind(s,1), and the next index after that by nextind(s,4) and so on.Extraction of a substring using range indexing also expects valid byte indices or an error is thrown:julia> s[1:1]\n\"∀\"\n\njulia> s[1:2]\nERROR: StringIndexError(\"∀ x ∃ y\", 2)\nStacktrace:\n[...]\n\njulia> s[1:4]\n\"∀ \"Because of variable-length encodings, the number of characters in a string (given by length(s)) is not always the same as the last index.

Fortunately, the above awkward idiom is unnecessary for iterating through the characters in a string, since you can just use the string as an iterable object, no exception handling required:julia> for c in s\n           println(c)\n       end\n∀\n\nx\n\n∃\n\nyStrings in Julia can contain invalid UTF-8 code unit sequences. This convention allows to treat any byte sequence as a String. In such situations a rule is that when parsing a sequence of code units from left to right characters are formed by the longest sequence of 8-bit code units that matches the start of one of the following bit patterns (each x can be 0 or 1):0xxxxxxx;\n110xxxxx 10xxxxxx;\n1110xxxx 10xxxxxx 10xxxxxx;\n11110xxx 10xxxxxx 10xxxxxx 10xxxxxx;\n10xxxxxx;\n11111xxx.In particular this implies that overlong and too high code unit sequences are accepted. This rule is best explained by an example:julia> s = \"\\xc0\\xa0\\xe2\\x88\\xe2|\"\n\"\\xc0\\xa0\\xe2\\x88\\xe2|\"\n\njulia> foreach(display, s)\n\'\\xc0\\xa0\': [overlong] ASCII/Unicode U+0020 (category Zs: Separator, space)\n\'\\xe2\\x88\': Malformed UTF-8 (category Ma: Malformed, bad data)\n\'\\xe2\': Malformed UTF-8 (category Ma: Malformed, bad data)\n\'|\': ASCII/Unicode U+007c (category Sm: Symbol, math)\n\njulia> isvalid.(collect(s))\n4-element BitArray{1}:\n false\n false\n false\n  true\n\njulia> s2 = \"\\xf7\\xbf\\xbf\\xbf\"\n\"\\U1fffff\"\n\njulia> foreach(display, s2)\n\'\\U1fffff\': Unicode U+1fffff (category In: Invalid, too high)We can see that the first two code units in the string s form an overlong encoding of space character. It is invalid, but is accepted in a string as a single character. The next two code units form a valid start of a three-byte UTF-8 sequence. However, the fifth code unit \\xe2 is not its valid continuation. Therefore code units 3 and 4 are also interpreted as malformed characters in this string. Similarly code unit 5 forms a malformed character because | is not a valid continuation to it. Finally the string s2 contains one too high code point.Julia uses the UTF-8 encoding by default, and support for new encodings can be added by packages. For example, the LegacyStrings.jl package implements UTF16String and UTF32String types. Additional discussion of other encodings and how to implement support for them is beyond the scope of this document for the time being. For further discussion of UTF-8 encoding issues, see the section below on byte array literals. The transcode function is provided to convert data between the various UTF-xx encodings, primarily for working with external data and libraries."

The resulting string may contain different characters than the input strings, and its number of characters may be lower than sum of numbers of characters of the concatenated strings, e.g.:julia> a, b = \"\\xe2\\x88\", \"\\x80\"\n(\"\\xe2\\x88\", \"\\x80\")\n\njulia> c = a*b\n\"∀\"\n\njulia> collect.([a, b, c])\n3-element Array{Array{Char,1},1}:\n [\'\\xe2\\x88\']\n [\'\\x80\']\n [\'∀\']\n\njulia> length.([a, b, c])\n3-element Array{Int64,1}:\n 1\n 1\n 1This situation can happen only for invalid UTF-8 strings. For valid UTF-8 strings concatenation preserves all characters in strings and additivity of string lengths.Julia also provides * for string concatenation:julia> greet * \", \" * whom * \".\\n\"\n\"Hello, world.\\n\"While * may seem like a surprising choice to users of languages that provide + for string concatenation, this use of * has precedent in mathematics, particularly in abstract algebra.In mathematics, + usually denotes a commutative operation, where the order of the operands does not matter. An example of this is matrix addition, where A + B == B + A for any matrices A and B that have the same shape. In contrast, * typically denotes a noncommutative operation, where the order of the operands does matter. An example of this is matrix multiplication, where in general A * B != B * A. As with matrix multiplication, string concatenation is noncommutative: greet * whom != whom * greet. As such, * is a more natural choice for an infix string concatenation operator, consistent with common mathematical use.More precisely, the set of all finite-length strings S together with the string concatenation operator * forms a free monoid (S, *). The identity element of this set is the empty string, \"\". Whenever a free monoid is not commutative, the operation is typically represented as \\cdot, *, or a similar symbol, rather than +, which as stated usually implies commutativity."

For example:julia> str = \"\"\"\n           Hello,\n           world.\n         \"\"\"\n\"  Hello,\\n  world.\\n\"In this case the final (empty) line before the closing \"\"\" sets the indentation level.The dedentation level is determined as the longest common starting sequence of spaces or tabs in all lines, excluding the line following the opening \"\"\" and lines containing only spaces or tabs (the line containing the closing \"\"\" is always included). Then for all lines, excluding the text following the opening \"\"\", the common starting sequence is removed (including lines containing only spaces and tabs if they start with this sequence), e.g.:julia> \"\"\"    This\n         is\n           a test\"\"\"\n\"    This\\nis\\n  a test\"Next, if the opening \"\"\" is followed by a newline, the newline is stripped from the resulting string.\"\"\"hello\"\"\"is equivalent to\"\"\"\nhello\"\"\"but\"\"\"\n\nhello\"\"\"will contain a literal newline at the beginning.Stripping of the newline is performed after the dedentation.

    "text": "Julia has Perl-compatible regular expressions (regexes), as provided by the PCRE library. Regular expressions are related to strings in two ways: the obvious connection is that regular expressions are used to find regular patterns in strings; the other connection is that regular expressions are themselves input as strings, which are parsed into a state machine that can be used to efficiently search for patterns in strings. In Julia, regular expressions are input using non-standard string literals prefixed with various identifiers beginning with r. The most basic regular expression literal without any options turned on just uses r\"...\":julia> r\"^\\s*(?:#|$)\"\nr\"^\\s*(?:#|$)\"\n\njulia> typeof(ans)\nRegexTo check if a regex matches a string, use occursin:julia> occursin(r\"^\\s*(?:#|$)\", \"not a comment\")\nfalse\n\njulia> occursin(r\"^\\s*(?:#|$)\", \"# a comment\")\ntrueAs one can see here, occursin simply returns true or false, indicating whether a match for the given regex occurs in the string. Commonly, however, one wants to know not just whether a string matched, but also how it matched. To capture this information about a match, use the match function instead:julia> match(r\"^\\s*(?:#|$)\", \"not a comment\")\n\njulia> match(r\"^\\s*(?:#|$)\", \"# a comment\")\nRegexMatch(\"#\")If the regular expression does not match the given string, match returns nothing – a special value that does not print anything at the interactive prompt. Other than not printing, it is a completely normal value and you can test for it programmatically:m = match(r\"^\\s*(?:#|$)\", line)\nif m === nothing\n    println(\"not a comment\")\nelse\n    println(\"blank or comment\")\nendIf a regular expression does match, the value returned by match is a RegexMatch object. These objects record how the expression matches, including the substring that the pattern matches and any captured substrings, if there are any. This example only captures the portion of the substring that matches, but perhaps we want to capture any non-blank text after the comment character. We could do the following:julia> m = match(r\"^\\s*(?:#\\s*(.*?)\\s*$|$)\", \"# a comment \")\nRegexMatch(\"# a comment \", 1=\"a comment\")When calling match, you have the option to specify an index at which to start the search. For example:julia> m = match(r\"[0-9]\",\"aaaa1aaaa2aaaa3\",1)\nRegexMatch(\"1\")\n\njulia> m = match(r\"[0-9]\",\"aaaa1aaaa2aaaa3\",6)\nRegexMatch(\"2\")\n\njulia> m = match(r\"[0-9]\",\"aaaa1aaaa2aaaa3\",11)\nRegexMatch(\"3\")You can extract the following info from a RegexMatch object:the entire substring matched: m.match\nthe captured substrings as an array of strings: m.captures\nthe offset at which the whole match begins: m.offset\nthe offsets of the captured substrings as a vector: m.offsetsFor when a capture doesn\'t match, instead of a substring, m.captures contains nothing in that position, and m.offsets has a zero offset (recall that indices in Julia are 1-based, so a zero offset into a string is invalid). Here is a pair of somewhat contrived examples:julia> m = match(r\"(a|b)(c)?(d)\", \"acd\")\nRegexMatch(\"acd\", 1=\"a\", 2=\"c\", 3=\"d\")\n\njulia> m.match\n\"acd\"\n\njulia> m.captures\n3-element Array{Union{Nothing, SubString{String}},1}:\n \"a\"\n \"c\"\n \"d\"\n\njulia> m.offset\n1\n\njulia> m.offsets\n3-element Array{Int64,1}:\n 1\n 2\n 3\n\njulia> m = match(r\"(a|b)(c)?(d)\", \"ad\")\nRegexMatch(\"ad\", 1=\"a\", 2=nothing, 3=\"d\")\n\njulia> m.match\n\"ad\"\n\njulia> m.captures\n3-element Array{Union{Nothing, SubString{String}},1}:\n \"a\"\n nothing\n \"d\"\n\njulia> m.offset\n1\n\njulia> m.offsets\n3-element Array{Int64,1}:\n 1\n 0\n 2It is convenient to have captures returned as an array so that one can use destructuring syntax to bind them to local variables:julia> first, second, third = m.captures; first\n\"a\"Captures can also be accessed by indexing the RegexMatch object with the number or name of the capture group:julia> m=match(r\"(?<hour>\\d+):(?<minute>\\d+)\",\"12:45\")\nRegexMatch(\"12:45\", hour=\"12\", minute=\"45\")\n\njulia> m[:minute]\n\"45\"\n\njulia> m[2]\n\"45\"Captures can be referenced in a substitution string when using replace by using \\n to refer to the nth capture group and prefixing the substitution string with s. Capture group 0 refers to the entire match object. Named capture groups can be referenced in the substitution with g<groupname>. For example:julia> replace(\"first second\", r\"(\\w+) (?<agroup>\\w+)\" => s\"\\g<agroup> \\1\")\n\"second first\"Numbered capture groups can also be referenced as \\g<n> for disambiguation, as in:julia> replace(\"a\", r\".\" => s\"\\g<0>1\")\n\"a1\"You can modify the behavior of regular expressions by some combination of the flags i, m, s, and x after the closing double quote mark. These flags have the same meaning as they do in Perl, as explained in this excerpt from the perlre manpage:i   Do case-insensitive pattern matching.\n\n    If locale matching rules are in effect, the case map is taken\n    from the current locale for code points less than 255, and\n    from Unicode rules for larger code points. However, matches\n    that would cross the Unicode rules/non-Unicode rules boundary\n    (ords 255/256) will not succeed.\n\nm   Treat string as multiple lines.  That is, change \"^\" and \"$\"\n    from matching the start or end of the string to matching the\n    start or end of any line anywhere within the string.\n\ns   Treat string as single line.  That is, change \".\" to match any\n    character whatsoever, even a newline, which normally it would\n    not match.\n\n    Used together, as r\"\"ms, they let the \".\" match any character\n    whatsoever, while still allowing \"^\" and \"$\" to match,\n    respectively, just after and just before newlines within the\n    string.\n\nx   Tells the regular expression parser to ignore most whitespace\n    that is neither backslashed nor within a character class. You\n    can use this to break up your regular expression into\n    (slightly) more readable parts. The \'#\' character is also\n    treated as a metacharacter introducing a comment, just as in\n    ordinary code.For example, the following regex has all three flags turned on:julia> r\"a+.*b+.*?d$\"ism\nr\"a+.*b+.*?d$\"ims\n\njulia> match(r\"a+.*b+.*?d$\"ism, \"Goodbye,\\nOh, angry,\\nBad world\\n\")\nRegexMatch(\"angry,\\nBad world\")The r\"...\" literal is constructed without interpolation and unescaping (except for quotation mark \" which still has to be escaped). Here is an example showing the difference from standard string literals:julia> x = 10\n10\n\njulia> r\"$x\"\nr\"$x\"\n\njulia> \"$x\"\n\"10\"\n\njulia> r\"\\x\"\nr\"\\x\"\n\njulia> \"\\x\"\nERROR: syntax: invalid escape sequenceTriple-quoted regex strings, of the form r\"\"\"...\"\"\", are also supported (and may be convenient for regular expressions containing quotation marks or newlines)."

This form lets you use string notation to express read only literal byte arrays – i.e. arrays of UInt8 values. The type of those objects is CodeUnits{UInt8, String}. The rules for byte array literals are the following:ASCII characters and ASCII escapes produce a single byte.\n\\x and octal escape sequences produce the byte corresponding to the escape value.\nUnicode escape sequences produce a sequence of bytes encoding that code point in UTF-8.There is some overlap between these rules since the behavior of \\x and octal escapes less than 0x80 (128) are covered by both of the first two rules, but here these rules agree. Together, these rules allow one to easily use ASCII characters, arbitrary byte values, and UTF-8 sequences to produce arrays of bytes. Here is an example using all three:julia> b\"DATA\\xff\\u2200\"\n8-element Base.CodeUnits{UInt8,String}:\n 0x44\n 0x41\n 0x54\n 0x41\n 0xff\n 0xe2\n 0x88\n 0x80The ASCII string \"DATA\" corresponds to the bytes 68, 65, 84, 65. \\xff produces the single byte 255. The Unicode escape \\u2200 is encoded in UTF-8 as the three bytes 226, 136, 128. Note that the resulting byte array does not correspond to a valid UTF-8 string:julia> isvalid(\"DATA\\xff\\u2200\")\nfalseAs it was mentioned CodeUnits{UInt8,String} type behaves like read only array of UInt8 and if you need a standard vector you can convert it using Vector{UInt8}:julia> x = b\"123\"\n3-element Base.CodeUnits{UInt8,String}:\n 0x31\n 0x32\n 0x33\n\njulia> x[1]\n0x31\n\njulia> x[1] = 0x32\nERROR: setindex! not defined for Base.CodeUnits{UInt8,String}\n[...]\n\njulia> Vector{UInt8}(x)\n3-element Array{UInt8,1}:\n 0x31\n 0x32\n 0x33Also observe the significant distinction between \\xff and \\uff: the former escape sequence encodes the byte 255, whereas the latter escape sequence represents the code point 255, which is encoded as two bytes in UTF-8:julia> b\"\\xff\"\n1-element Base.CodeUnits{UInt8,String}:\n 0xff\n\njulia> b\"\\uff\"\n2-element Base.CodeUnits{UInt8,String}:\n 0xc3\n 0xbfCharacter literals use the same behavior.For code points less than \\u80, it happens that the UTF-8 encoding of each code point is just the single byte produced by the corresponding \\x escape, so the distinction can safely be ignored. For the escapes \\x80 through \\xff as compared to \\u80 through \\uff, however, there is a major difference: the former escapes all encode single bytes, which – unless followed by very specific continuation bytes – do not form valid UTF-8 data, whereas the latter escapes all represent Unicode code points with two-byte encodings.If this is all extremely confusing, try reading \"The Absolute Minimum Every Software Developer Absolutely, Positively Must Know About Unicode and Character Sets\". It\'s an excellent introduction to Unicode and UTF-8, and may help alleviate some confusion regarding the matter."

Version number literals create VersionNumber objects which follow the specifications of semantic versioning, and therefore are composed of major, minor and patch numeric values, followed by pre-release and build alpha-numeric annotations. For example, v\"0.2.1-rc1+win64\" is broken into major version 0, minor version 2, patch version 1, pre-release rc1 and build win64. When entering a version literal, everything except the major version number is optional, therefore e.g.  v\"0.2\" is equivalent to v\"0.2.0\" (with empty pre-release/build annotations), v\"2\" is equivalent to v\"2.0.0\", and so on.VersionNumber objects are mostly useful to easily and correctly compare two (or more) versions. For example, the constant VERSION holds Julia version number as a VersionNumber object, and therefore one can define some version-specific behavior using simple statements as:if v\"0.2\" <= VERSION < v\"0.3-\"\n    # do something specific to 0.2 release series\nendNote that in the above example the non-standard version number v\"0.3-\" is used, with a trailing -: this notation is a Julia extension of the standard, and it\'s used to indicate a version which is lower than any 0.3 release, including all of its pre-releases. So in the above example the code would only run with stable 0.2 versions, and exclude such versions as v\"0.3.0-rc1\". In order to also allow for unstable (i.e. pre-release) 0.2 versions, the lower bound check should be modified like this: v\"0.2-\" <= VERSION.Another non-standard version specification extension allows one to use a trailing + to express an upper limit on build versions, e.g.  VERSION > v\"0.2-rc1+\" can be used to mean any version above 0.2-rc1 and any of its builds: it will return false for version v\"0.2-rc1+win64\" and true for v\"0.2-rc2\".It is good practice to use such special versions in comparisons (particularly, the trailing - should always be used on upper bounds unless there\'s a good reason not to), but they must not be used as the actual version number of anything, as they are invalid in the semantic versioning scheme.Besides being used for the VERSION constant, VersionNumber objects are widely used in the Pkg module, to specify packages versions and their dependencies."

Function arguments themselves act as new variable bindings (new locations that can refer to values), but the values they refer to are identical to the passed values. Modifications to mutable values (such as Arrays) made within a function will be visible to the caller.

    "category": "section",
    "text": "The value returned by a function is the value of the last expression evaluated, which, by default, is the last expression in the body of the function definition. In the example function, f, from the previous section this is the value of the expression x + y. As in C and most other imperative or functional languages, the return keyword causes a function to return immediately, providing an expression whose value is returned:function g(x,y)\n    return x * y\n    x + y\nendSince function definitions can be entered into interactive sessions, it is easy to compare these definitions:julia> f(x,y) = x + y\nf (generic function with 1 method)\n\njulia> function g(x,y)\n           return x * y\n           x + y\n       end\ng (generic function with 1 method)\n\njulia> f(2,3)\n5\n\njulia> g(2,3)\n6Of course, in a purely linear function body like g, the usage of return is pointless since the expression x + y is never evaluated and we could simply make x * y the last expression in the function and omit the return. In conjunction with other control flow, however, return is of real use. Here, for example, is a function that computes the hypotenuse length of a right triangle with sides of length x and y, avoiding overflow:julia> function hypot(x,y)\n           x = abs(x)\n           y = abs(y)\n           if x > y\n               r = y/x\n               return x*sqrt(1+r*r)\n           end\n           if y == 0\n               return zero(x)\n           end\n           r = x/y\n           return y*sqrt(1+r*r)\n       end\nhypot (generic function with 1 method)\n\njulia> hypot(3, 4)\n5.0There are three possible points of return from this function, returning the values of three different expressions, depending on the values of x and y. The return on the last line could be omitted since it is the last expression.A return type can also be specified in the function declaration using the :: operator. This converts the return value to the specified type.julia> function g(x, y)::Int8\n           return x * y\n       end;\n\njulia> typeof(g(1, 2))\nInt8This function will always return an Int8 regardless of the types of x and y.

They can be used as arguments, and they can be returned as values. They can also be created anonymously, without being given a name, using either of these syntaxes:julia> x -> x^2 + 2x - 1\n#1 (generic function with 1 method)\n\njulia> function (x)\n           x^2 + 2x - 1\n       end\n#3 (generic function with 1 method)This creates a function taking one argument x and returning the value of the polynomial x^2 + 2x - 1 at that value. Notice that the result is a generic function, but with a compiler-generated name based on consecutive numbering.The primary use for anonymous functions is passing them to functions which take other functions as arguments. A classic example is map, which applies a function to each value of an array and returns a new array containing the resulting values:julia> map(round, [1.2,3.5,1.7])\n3-element Array{Float64,1}:\n 1.0\n 4.0\n 2.0This is fine if a named function effecting the transform already exists to pass as the first argument to map. Often, however, a ready-to-use, named function does not exist. In these situations, the anonymous function construct allows easy creation of a single-use function object without needing a name:julia> map(x -> x^2 + 2x - 1, [1,3,-1])\n3-element Array{Int64,1}:\n  2\n 14\n -2An anonymous function accepting multiple arguments can be written using the syntax (x,y,z)->2x+y-z. A zero-argument anonymous function is written as ()->3. The idea of a function with no arguments may seem strange, but is useful for \"delaying\" a computation. In this usage, a block of code is wrapped in a zero-argument function, which is later invoked by calling it as f."

Julia supports simple tuple \"destructuring\" that facilitates this:julia> x, y = foo(2,3)\n(5, 6)\n\njulia> x\n5\n\njulia> y\n6You can also return multiple values via an explicit usage of the return keyword:function foo(a,b)\n    return a+b, a*b\nendThis has the exact same effect as the previous definition of foo."

Such functions are traditionally known as \"varargs\" functions, which is short for \"variable number of arguments\". You can define a varargs function by following the last argument with an ellipsis:julia> bar(a,b,x...) = (a,b,x)\nbar (generic function with 1 method)The variables a and b are bound to the first two argument values as usual, and the variable x is bound to an iterable collection of the zero or more values passed to bar after its first two arguments:julia> bar(1,2)\n(1, 2, ())\n\njulia> bar(1,2,3)\n(1, 2, (3,))\n\njulia> bar(1, 2, 3, 4)\n(1, 2, (3, 4))\n\njulia> bar(1,2,3,4,5,6)\n(1, 2, (3, 4, 5, 6))In all these cases, x is bound to a tuple of the trailing values passed to bar.It is possible to constrain the number of values passed as a variable argument; this will be discussed later in Parametrically-constrained Varargs methods.On the flip side, it is often handy to \"splat\" the values contained in an iterable collection into a function call as individual arguments. To do this, one also uses ... but in the function call instead:julia> x = (3, 4)\n(3, 4)\n\njulia> bar(1,2,x...)\n(1, 2, (3, 4))In this case a tuple of values is spliced into a varargs call precisely where the variable number of arguments go.

    "category": "section",
    "text": "Some functions need a large number of arguments, or have a large number of behaviors. Remembering how to call such functions can be difficult. Keyword arguments can make these complex interfaces easier to use and extend by allowing arguments to be identified by name instead of only by position.For example, consider a function plot that plots a line. This function might have many options, for controlling line style, width, color, and so on. If it accepts keyword arguments, a possible call might look like plot(x, y, width=2), where we have chosen to specify only line width. Notice that this serves two purposes. The call is easier to read, since we can label an argument with its meaning. It also becomes possible to pass any subset of a large number of arguments, in any order.Functions with keyword arguments are defined using a semicolon in the signature:function plot(x, y; style=\"solid\", width=1, color=\"black\")\n    ###\nendWhen the function is called, the semicolon is optional: one can either call plot(x, y, width=2) or plot(x, y; width=2), but the former style is more common. An explicit semicolon is required only for passing varargs or computed keywords as described below.Keyword argument default values are evaluated only when necessary (when a corresponding keyword argument is not passed), and in left-to-right order. Therefore default expressions may refer to prior keyword arguments.The types of keyword arguments can be made explicit as follows:function f(;x::Int=1)\n    ###\nendExtra keyword arguments can be collected using ..., as in varargs functions:function f(x; y=0, kwargs...)\n    ###\nendIf a keyword argument is not assigned a default value in the method definition, then it is required: an UndefKeywordError exception will be thrown if the caller does not assign it a value:function f(x; y)\n    ###\nend\nf(3, y=5) # ok, y is assigned\nf(3)      # throws UndefKeywordError(:y)Inside f, kwargs will be a named tuple. Named tuples (as well as dictionaries) can be passed as keyword arguments using a semicolon in a call, e.g. f(x, z=1; kwargs...).One can also pass key => value expressions after a semicolon. For example, plot(x, y; :width => 2) is equivalent to plot(x, y, width=2). This is useful in situations where the keyword name is computed at runtime.The nature of keyword arguments makes it possible to specify the same argument more than once. For example, in the call plot(x, y; options..., width=2) it is possible that the options structure also contains a value for width. In such a case the rightmost occurrence takes precedence; in this example, width is certain to have the value 2. However, explicitly specifying the same keyword argument multiple times, for example plot(x, y, width=2, width=3), is not allowed and results in a syntax error."

    "text": "Passing functions as arguments to other functions is a powerful technique, but the syntax for it is not always convenient. Such calls are especially awkward to write when the function argument requires multiple lines. As an example, consider calling map on a function with several cases:map(x->begin\n           if x < 0 && iseven(x)\n               return 0\n           elseif x == 0\n               return 1\n           else\n               return x\n           end\n       end,\n    [A, B, C])Julia provides a reserved word do for rewriting this code more clearly:map([A, B, C]) do x\n    if x < 0 && iseven(x)\n        return 0\n    elseif x == 0\n        return 1\n    else\n        return x\n    end\nendThe do x syntax creates an anonymous function with argument x and passes it as the first argument to map. Similarly, do a,b would create a two-argument anonymous function, and a plain do would declare that what follows is an anonymous function of the form () -> ....How these arguments are initialized depends on the \"outer\" function; here, map will sequentially set x to A, B, C, calling the anonymous function on each, just as would happen in the syntax map(func, [A, B, C]).This syntax makes it easier to use functions to effectively extend the language, since calls look like normal code blocks. There are many possible uses quite different from map, such as managing system state. For example, there is a version of open that runs code ensuring that the opened file is eventually closed:open(\"outfile\", \"w\") do io\n    write(io, data)\nendThis is accomplished by the following definition:function open(f::Function, args...)\n    io = open(args...)\n    try\n        f(io)\n    finally\n        close(io)\n    end\nendHere, open first opens the file for writing and then passes the resulting output stream to the anonymous function you defined in the do ... end block. After your function exits, open will make sure that the stream is properly closed, regardless of whether your function exited normally or threw an exception. (The try/finally construct will be described in Control Flow.)With the do block syntax, it helps to check the documentation or implementation to know how the arguments of the user function are initialized.A do block, like any other inner function, can \"capture\" variables from its enclosing scope. For example, the variable data in the above example of open...do is captured from the outer scope. Captured variables can create performance challenges as discussed in performance tips."

    "title": "Dot Syntax for Vectorizing Functions",
    "category": "section",
    "text": "In technical-computing languages, it is common to have \"vectorized\" versions of functions, which simply apply a given function f(x) to each element of an array A to yield a new array via f(A). This kind of syntax is convenient for data processing, but in other languages vectorization is also often required for performance: if loops are slow, the \"vectorized\" version of a function can call fast library code written in a low-level language. In Julia, vectorized functions are not required for performance, and indeed it is often beneficial to write your own loops (see Performance Tips), but they can still be convenient. Therefore, any Julia function f can be applied elementwise to any array (or other collection) with the syntax f.(A). For example sin can be applied to all elements in the vector A, like so:julia> A = [1.0, 2.0, 3.0]\n3-element Array{Float64,1}:\n 1.0\n 2.0\n 3.0\n\njulia> sin.(A)\n3-element Array{Float64,1}:\n 0.8414709848078965\n 0.9092974268256817\n 0.1411200080598672Of course, you can omit the dot if you write a specialized \"vector\" method of f, e.g. via f(A::AbstractArray) = map(f, A), and this is just as efficient as f.(A). But that approach requires you to decide in advance which functions you want to vectorize.More generally, f.(args...) is actually equivalent to broadcast(f, args...), which allows you to operate on multiple arrays (even of different shapes), or a mix of arrays and scalars (see Broadcasting). For example, if you have f(x,y) = 3x + 4y, then f.(pi,A) will return a new array consisting of f(pi,a) for each a in A, and f.(vector1,vector2) will return a new vector consisting of f(vector1[i],vector2[i]) for each index i (throwing an exception if the vectors have different length).julia> f(x,y) = 3x + 4y;\n\njulia> A = [1.0, 2.0, 3.0];\n\njulia> B = [4.0, 5.0, 6.0];\n\njulia> f.(pi, A)\n3-element Array{Float64,1}:\n 13.42477796076938\n 17.42477796076938\n 21.42477796076938\n\njulia> f.(A, B)\n3-element Array{Float64,1}:\n 19.0\n 26.0\n 33.0Moreover, nested f.(args...) calls are fused into a single broadcast loop. For example, sin.(cos.(X)) is equivalent to broadcast(x -> sin(cos(x)), X), similar to [sin(cos(x)) for x in X]: there is only a single loop over X, and a single array is allocated for the result. [In contrast, sin(cos(X)) in a typical \"vectorized\" language would first allocate one temporary array for tmp=cos(X), and then compute sin(tmp) in a separate loop, allocating a second array.] This loop fusion is not a compiler optimization that may or may not occur, it is a syntactic guarantee whenever nested f.(args...) calls are encountered. Technically, the fusion stops as soon as a \"non-dot\" function call is encountered; for example, in sin.(sort(cos.(X))) the sin and cos loops cannot be merged because of the intervening sort function.Finally, the maximum efficiency is typically achieved when the output array of a vectorized operation is pre-allocated, so that repeated calls do not allocate new arrays over and over again for the results (see Pre-allocating outputs). A convenient syntax for this is X .= ..., which is equivalent to broadcast!(identity, X, ...) except that, as above, the broadcast! loop is fused with any nested \"dot\" calls. For example, X .= sin.(Y) is equivalent to broadcast!(sin, X, Y), overwriting X with sin.(Y) in-place. If the left-hand side is an array-indexing expression, e.g. X[2:end] .= sin.(Y), then it translates to broadcast! on a view, e.g. broadcast!(sin, view(X, 2:lastindex(X)), Y), so that the left-hand side is updated in-place.Since adding dots to many operations and function calls in an expression can be tedious and lead to code that is difficult to read, the macro @. is provided to convert every function call, operation, and assignment in an expression into the \"dotted\" version.julia> Y = [1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0];\n\njulia> X = similar(Y); # pre-allocate output array\n\njulia> @. X = sin(cos(Y)) # equivalent to X .= sin.(cos.(Y))\n4-element Array{Float64,1}:\n  0.5143952585235492\n -0.4042391538522658\n -0.8360218615377305\n -0.6080830096407656Binary (or unary) operators like .+ are handled with the same mechanism: they are equivalent to broadcast calls and are fused with other nested \"dot\" calls.  X .+= Y etcetera is equivalent to X .= X .+ Y and results in a fused in-place assignment;  see also dot operators.You can also combine dot operations with function chaining using |>, as in this example:julia> [1:5;] .|> [x->x^2, inv, x->2*x, -, isodd]\n5-element Array{Real,1}:\n    1\n    0.5\n    6\n   -4\n true"

Here\'s an example of a begin block:julia> z = begin\n           x = 1\n           y = 2\n           x + y\n       end\n3Since these are fairly small, simple expressions, they could easily be placed onto a single line, which is where the (;) chain syntax comes in handy:julia> z = (x = 1; y = 2; x + y)\n3This syntax is particularly useful with the terse single-line function definition form introduced in Functions. Although it is typical, there is no requirement that begin blocks be multiline or that (;) chains be single-line:julia> begin x = 1; y = 2; x + y end\n3\n\njulia> (x = 1;\n        y = 2;\n        x + y)\n3"

    "title": "Conditional Evaluation",
    "category": "section",
    "text": "Conditional evaluation allows portions of code to be evaluated or not evaluated depending on the value of a boolean expression. Here is the anatomy of the if-elseif-else conditional syntax:if x < y\n    println(\"x is less than y\")\nelseif x > y\n    println(\"x is greater than y\")\nelse\n    println(\"x is equal to y\")\nendIf the condition expression x < y is true, then the corresponding block is evaluated; otherwise the condition expression x > y is evaluated, and if it is true, the corresponding block is evaluated; if neither expression is true, the else block is evaluated. Here it is in action:julia> function test(x, y)\n           if x < y\n               println(\"x is less than y\")\n           elseif x > y\n               println(\"x is greater than y\")\n           else\n               println(\"x is equal to y\")\n           end\n       end\ntest (generic function with 1 method)\n\njulia> test(1, 2)\nx is less than y\n\njulia> test(2, 1)\nx is greater than y\n\njulia> test(1, 1)\nx is equal to yThe elseif and else blocks are optional, and as many elseif blocks as desired can be used. The condition expressions in the if-elseif-else construct are evaluated until the first one evaluates to true, after which the associated block is evaluated, and no further condition expressions or blocks are evaluated.if blocks are \"leaky\", i.e. they do not introduce a local scope. This means that new variables defined inside the if clauses can be used after the if block, even if they weren\'t defined before. So, we could have defined the test function above asjulia> function test(x,y)\n           if x < y\n               relation = \"less than\"\n           elseif x == y\n               relation = \"equal to\"\n           else\n               relation = \"greater than\"\n           end\n           println(\"x is \", relation, \" y.\")\n       end\ntest (generic function with 1 method)\n\njulia> test(2, 1)\nx is greater than y.The variable relation is declared inside the if block, but used outside. However, when depending on this behavior, make sure all possible code paths define a value for the variable. The following change to the above function results in a runtime errorjulia> function test(x,y)\n           if x < y\n               relation = \"less than\"\n           elseif x == y\n               relation = \"equal to\"\n           end\n           println(\"x is \", relation, \" y.\")\n       end\ntest (generic function with 1 method)\n\njulia> test(1,2)\nx is less than y.\n\njulia> test(2,1)\nERROR: UndefVarError: relation not defined\nStacktrace:\n [1] test(::Int64, ::Int64) at ./none:7if blocks also return a value, which may seem unintuitive to users coming from many other languages. This value is simply the return value of the last executed statement in the branch that was chosen, sojulia> x = 3\n3\n\njulia> if x > 0\n           \"positive!\"\n       else\n           \"negative...\"\n       end\n\"positive!\"Note that very short conditional statements (one-liners) are frequently expressed using Short-Circuit Evaluation in Julia, as outlined in the next section.Unlike C, MATLAB, Perl, Python, and Ruby – but like Java, and a few other stricter, typed languages – it is an error if the value of a conditional expression is anything but true or false:julia> if 1\n           println(\"true\")\n       end\nERROR: TypeError: non-boolean (Int64) used in boolean contextThis error indicates that the conditional was of the wrong type: Int64 rather than the required Bool.The so-called \"ternary operator\", ?:, is closely related to the if-elseif-else syntax, but is used where a conditional choice between single expression values is required, as opposed to conditional execution of longer blocks of code. It gets its name from being the only operator in most languages taking three operands:a ? b : cThe expression a, before the ?, is a condition expression, and the ternary operation evaluates the expression b, before the :, if the condition a is true or the expression c, after the :, if it is false. Note that the spaces around ? and : are mandatory: an expression like a?b:c is not a valid ternary expression (but a newline is acceptable after both the ? and the :).The easiest way to understand this behavior is to see an example. In the previous example, the println call is shared by all three branches: the only real choice is which literal string to print. This could be written more concisely using the ternary operator. For the sake of clarity, let\'s try a two-way version first:julia> x = 1; y = 2;\n\njulia> println(x < y ? \"less than\" : \"not less than\")\nless than\n\njulia> x = 1; y = 0;\n\njulia> println(x < y ? \"less than\" : \"not less than\")\nnot less thanIf the expression x < y is true, the entire ternary operator expression evaluates to the string \"less than\" and otherwise it evaluates to the string \"not less than\". The original three-way example requires chaining multiple uses of the ternary operator together:julia> test(x, y) = println(x < y ? \"x is less than y\"    :\n                            x > y ? \"x is greater than y\" : \"x is equal to y\")\ntest (generic function with 1 method)\n\njulia> test(1, 2)\nx is less than y\n\njulia> test(2, 1)\nx is greater than y\n\njulia> test(1, 1)\nx is equal to yTo facilitate chaining, the operator associates from right to left.It is significant that like if-elseif-else, the expressions before and after the : are only evaluated if the condition expression evaluates to true or false, respectively:julia> v(x) = (println(x); x)\nv (generic function with 1 method)\n\njulia> 1 < 2 ? v(\"yes\") : v(\"no\")\nyes\n\"yes\"\n\njulia> 1 > 2 ? v(\"yes\") : v(\"no\")\nno\n\"no\""

    "title": "Short-Circuit Evaluation",
    "category": "section",
    "text": "Short-circuit evaluation is quite similar to conditional evaluation. The behavior is found in most imperative programming languages having the && and || boolean operators: in a series of boolean expressions connected by these operators, only the minimum number of expressions are evaluated as are necessary to determine the final boolean value of the entire chain. Explicitly, this means that:In the expression a && b, the subexpression b is only evaluated if a evaluates to true.\nIn the expression a || b, the subexpression b is only evaluated if a evaluates to false.The reasoning is that a && b must be false if a is false, regardless of the value of b, and likewise, the value of a || b must be true if a is true, regardless of the value of b. Both && and || associate to the right, but && has higher precedence than || does. It\'s easy to experiment with this behavior:julia> t(x) = (println(x); true)\nt (generic function with 1 method)\n\njulia> f(x) = (println(x); false)\nf (generic function with 1 method)\n\njulia> t(1) && t(2)\n1\n2\ntrue\n\njulia> t(1) && f(2)\n1\n2\nfalse\n\njulia> f(1) && t(2)\n1\nfalse\n\njulia> f(1) && f(2)\n1\nfalse\n\njulia> t(1) || t(2)\n1\ntrue\n\njulia> t(1) || f(2)\n1\ntrue\n\njulia> f(1) || t(2)\n1\n2\ntrue\n\njulia> f(1) || f(2)\n1\n2\nfalseYou can easily experiment in the same way with the associativity and precedence of various combinations of && and || operators.This behavior is frequently used in Julia to form an alternative to very short if statements. Instead of if <cond> <statement> end, one can write <cond> && <statement> (which could be read as: <cond> and then <statement>). Similarly, instead of if ! <cond> <statement> end, one can write <cond> || <statement> (which could be read as: <cond> or else <statement>).For example, a recursive factorial routine could be defined like this:julia> function fact(n::Int)\n           n >= 0 || error(\"n must be non-negative\")\n           n == 0 && return 1\n           n * fact(n-1)\n       end\nfact (generic function with 1 method)\n\njulia> fact(5)\n120\n\njulia> fact(0)\n1\n\njulia> fact(-1)\nERROR: n must be non-negative\nStacktrace:\n [1] error at ./error.jl:33 [inlined]\n [2] fact(::Int64) at ./none:2\n [3] top-level scopeBoolean operations without short-circuit evaluation can be done with the bitwise boolean operators introduced in Mathematical Operations and Elementary Functions: & and |. These are normal functions, which happen to support infix operator syntax, but always evaluate their arguments:julia> f(1) & t(2)\n1\n2\nfalse\n\njulia> t(1) | t(2)\n1\n2\ntrueJust like condition expressions used in if, elseif or the ternary operator, the operands of && or || must be boolean values (true or false). Using a non-boolean value anywhere except for the last entry in a conditional chain is an error:julia> 1 && true\nERROR: TypeError: non-boolean (Int64) used in boolean contextOn the other hand, any type of expression can be used at the end of a conditional chain. It will be evaluated and returned depending on the preceding conditionals:julia> true && (x = (1, 2, 3))\n(1, 2, 3)\n\njulia> false && (x = (1, 2, 3))\nfalse"

    "page": "Control Flow",
    "title": "Repeated Evaluation: Loops",
    "category": "section",
    "text": "There are two constructs for repeated evaluation of expressions: the while loop and the for loop. Here is an example of a while loop:julia> i = 1;\n\njulia> while i <= 5\n           println(i)\n           global i += 1\n       end\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5The while loop evaluates the condition expression (i <= 5 in this case), and as long it remains true, keeps also evaluating the body of the while loop. If the condition expression is false when the while loop is first reached, the body is never evaluated.The for loop makes common repeated evaluation idioms easier to write. Since counting up and down like the above while loop does is so common, it can be expressed more concisely with a for loop:julia> for i = 1:5\n           println(i)\n       end\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5Here the 1:5 is a range object, representing the sequence of numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. The for loop iterates through these values, assigning each one in turn to the variable i. One rather important distinction between the previous while loop form and the for loop form is the scope during which the variable is visible. If the variable i has not been introduced in another scope, in the for loop form, it is visible only inside of the for loop, and not outside/afterwards. You\'ll either need a new interactive session instance or a different variable name to test this:julia> for j = 1:5\n           println(j)\n       end\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n\njulia> j\nERROR: UndefVarError: j not definedSee Scope of Variables for a detailed explanation of variable scope and how it works in Julia.In general, the for loop construct can iterate over any container. In these cases, the alternative (but fully equivalent) keyword in or ∈ is typically used instead of =, since it makes the code read more clearly:julia> for i in [1,4,0]\n           println(i)\n       end\n1\n4\n0\n\njulia> for s ∈ [\"foo\",\"bar\",\"baz\"]\n           println(s)\n       end\nfoo\nbar\nbazVarious types of iterable containers will be introduced and discussed in later sections of the manual (see, e.g., Multi-dimensional Arrays).It is sometimes convenient to terminate the repetition of a while before the test condition is falsified or stop iterating in a for loop before the end of the iterable object is reached. This can be accomplished with the break keyword:julia> i = 1;\n\njulia> while true\n           println(i)\n           if i >= 5\n               break\n           end\n           global i += 1\n       end\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n\njulia> for j = 1:1000\n           println(j)\n           if j >= 5\n               break\n           end\n       end\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5Without the break keyword, the above while loop would never terminate on its own, and the for loop would iterate up to 1000. These loops are both exited early by using break.In other circumstances, it is handy to be able to stop an iteration and move on to the next one immediately. The continue keyword accomplishes this:julia> for i = 1:10\n           if i % 3 != 0\n               continue\n           end\n           println(i)\n       end\n3\n6\n9This is a somewhat contrived example since we could produce the same behavior more clearly by negating the condition and placing the println call inside the if block. In realistic usage there is more code to be evaluated after the continue, and often there are multiple points from which one calls continue.Multiple nested for loops can be combined into a single outer loop, forming the cartesian product of its iterables:julia> for i = 1:2, j = 3:4\n           println((i, j))\n       end\n(1, 3)\n(1, 4)\n(2, 3)\n(2, 4)With this syntax, iterables may still refer to outer loop variables; e.g. for i = 1:n, j = 1:i is valid. However a break statement inside such a loop exits the entire nest of loops, not just the inner one. Both variables (i and j) are set to their current iteration values each time the inner loop runs. Therefore, assignments to i will not be visible to subsequent iterations:julia> for i = 1:2, j = 3:4\n           println((i, j))\n           i = 0\n       end\n(1, 3)\n(1, 4)\n(2, 3)\n(2, 4)If this example were rewritten to use a for keyword for each variable, then the output would be different: the second and fourth values would contain 0."

    "text": "Tasks are a control flow feature that allows computations to be suspended and resumed in a flexible manner. This feature is sometimes called by other names, such as symmetric coroutines, lightweight threads, cooperative multitasking, or one-shot continuations.When a piece of computing work (in practice, executing a particular function) is designated as a Task, it becomes possible to interrupt it by switching to another Task. The original Task can later be resumed, at which point it will pick up right where it left off. At first, this may seem similar to a function call. However there are two key differences. First, switching tasks does not use any space, so any number of task switches can occur without consuming the call stack. Second, switching among tasks can occur in any order, unlike function calls, where the called function must finish executing before control returns to the calling function.This kind of control flow can make it much easier to solve certain problems. In some problems, the various pieces of required work are not naturally related by function calls; there is no obvious \"caller\" or \"callee\" among the jobs that need to be done. An example is the producer-consumer problem, where one complex procedure is generating values and another complex procedure is consuming them. The consumer cannot simply call a producer function to get a value, because the producer may have more values to generate and so might not yet be ready to return. With tasks, the producer and consumer can both run as long as they need to, passing values back and forth as necessary.Julia provides a Channel mechanism for solving this problem. A Channel is a waitable first-in first-out queue which can have multiple tasks reading from and writing to it.Let\'s define a producer task, which produces values via the put! call. To consume values, we need to schedule the producer to run in a new task. A special Channel constructor which accepts a 1-arg function as an argument can be used to run a task bound to a channel. We can then take! values repeatedly from the channel object:julia> function producer(c::Channel)\n           put!(c, \"start\")\n           for n=1:4\n               put!(c, 2n)\n           end\n           put!(c, \"stop\")\n       end;\n\njulia> chnl = Channel(producer);\n\njulia> take!(chnl)\n\"start\"\n\njulia> take!(chnl)\n2\n\njulia> take!(chnl)\n4\n\njulia> take!(chnl)\n6\n\njulia> take!(chnl)\n8\n\njulia> take!(chnl)\n\"stop\"One way to think of this behavior is that producer was able to return multiple times. Between calls to put!, the producer\'s execution is suspended and the consumer has control.The returned Channel can be used as an iterable object in a for loop, in which case the loop variable takes on all the produced values. The loop is terminated when the channel is closed.julia> for x in Channel(producer)\n           println(x)\n       end\nstart\n2\n4\n6\n8\nstopNote that we did not have to explicitly close the channel in the producer. This is because the act of binding a Channel to a Task associates the open lifetime of a channel with that of the bound task. The channel object is closed automatically when the task terminates. Multiple channels can be bound to a task, and vice-versa.While the Task constructor expects a 0-argument function, the Channel method which creates a channel bound task expects a function that accepts a single argument of type Channel. A common pattern is for the producer to be parameterized, in which case a partial function application is needed to create a 0 or 1 argument anonymous function.For Task objects this can be done either directly or by use of a convenience macro:function mytask(myarg)\n    ...\nend\n\ntaskHdl = Task(() -> mytask(7))\n# or, equivalently\ntaskHdl = @task mytask(7)To orchestrate more advanced work distribution patterns, bind and schedule can be used in conjunction with Task and Channel constructors to explicitly link a set of channels with a set of producer/consumer tasks.Note that currently Julia tasks are not scheduled to run on separate CPU cores. True kernel threads are discussed under the topic of Parallel Computing."

    "text": "Let us explore the low level construct yieldto to understand how task switching works. yieldto(task,value) suspends the current task, switches to the specified task, and causes that task\'s last yieldto call to return the specified value. Notice that yieldto is the only operation required to use task-style control flow; instead of calling and returning we are always just switching to a different task. This is why this feature is also called \"symmetric coroutines\"; each task is switched to and from using the same mechanism.yieldto is powerful, but most uses of tasks do not invoke it directly. Consider why this might be. If you switch away from the current task, you will probably want to switch back to it at some point, but knowing when to switch back, and knowing which task has the responsibility of switching back, can require considerable coordination. For example, put! and take! are blocking operations, which, when used in the context of channels maintain state to remember who the consumers are. Not needing to manually keep track of the consuming task is what makes put! easier to use than the low-level yieldto.In addition to yieldto, a few other basic functions are needed to use tasks effectively.current_task gets a reference to the currently-running task.\nistaskdone queries whether a task has exited.\nistaskstarted queries whether a task has run yet.\ntask_local_storage manipulates a key-value store specific to the current task."

    "text": "Most task switches occur as a result of waiting for events such as I/O requests, and are performed by a scheduler included in Julia Base. The scheduler maintains a queue of runnable tasks, and executes an event loop that restarts tasks based on external events such as message arrival.The basic function for waiting for an event is wait. Several objects implement wait; for example, given a Process object, wait will wait for it to exit. wait is often implicit; for example, a wait can happen inside a call to read to wait for data to be available.In all of these cases, wait ultimately operates on a Condition object, which is in charge of queueing and restarting tasks. When a task calls wait on a Condition, the task is marked as non-runnable, added to the condition\'s queue, and switches to the scheduler. The scheduler will then pick another task to run, or block waiting for external events. If all goes well, eventually an event handler will call notify on the condition, which causes tasks waiting for that condition to become runnable again.A task created explicitly by calling Task is initially not known to the scheduler. This allows you to manage tasks manually using yieldto if you wish. However, when such a task waits for an event, it still gets restarted automatically when the event happens, as you would expect. It is also possible to make the scheduler run a task whenever it can, without necessarily waiting for any events. This is done by calling schedule, or using the @async macro (see Parallel Computing for more details)."

The rules for when the same variable name does or doesn\'t refer to the same thing are called scope rules; this section spells them out in detail.Certain constructs in the language introduce scope blocks, which are regions of code that are eligible to be the scope of some set of variables. The scope of a variable cannot be an arbitrary set of source lines; instead, it will always line up with one of these blocks.

For example, in the following code the x inside foo refers to the x in the global scope of its module Bar:julia> module Bar\n           x = 1\n           foo() = x\n       end;and not a x in the scope where foo is used:julia> import .Bar\n\njulia> x = -1;\n\njulia> Bar.foo()\n1Thus lexical scope means that the scope of variables can be inferred from the source code alone."

    "title": "Local Scope",
    "category": "section",
    "text": "A new local scope is introduced by most code blocks (see above table for a complete list). A local scope inherits all the variables from a parent local scope, both for reading and writing. Additionally, the local scope inherits all globals that are assigned to in its parent global scope block (if it is surrounded by a global if or begin scope). Unlike global scopes, local scopes are not namespaces, thus variables in an inner scope cannot be retrieved from the parent scope through some sort of qualified access.The following rules and examples pertain to local scopes. A newly introduced variable in a local scope does not back-propagate to its parent scope. For example, here the z is not introduced into the top-level scope:julia> for i = 1:10\n           z = i\n       end\n\njulia> z\nERROR: UndefVarError: z not defined(Note, in this and all following examples it is assumed that their top-level is a global scope with a clean workspace, for instance a newly started REPL.)Inside a local scope a variable can be forced to be a new local variable using the local keyword:julia> x = 0;\n\njulia> for i = 1:10\n           local x # this is also the default\n           x = i + 1\n       end\n\njulia> x\n0Inside a local scope a global variable can be assigned to by using the keyword global:julia> for i = 1:10\n           global z\n           z = i\n       end\n\njulia> z\n10The location of both the local and global keywords within the scope block is irrelevant. The following is equivalent to the last example (although stylistically worse):julia> for i = 1:10\n           z = i\n           global z\n       end\n\njulia> z\n10The local and global keywords can also be applied to destructuring assignments, e.g. local x, y = 1, 2. In this case the keyword affects all listed variables.Local scopes are introduced by most block keywords, with notable exceptions of begin and if.In a local scope, all variables are inherited from its parent global scope block unless:an assignment would result in a modified global variable, or\na variable is specifically marked with the keyword local.Thus global variables are only inherited for reading but not for writing:julia> x, y = 1, 2;\n\njulia> function foo()\n           x = 2        # assignment introduces a new local\n           return x + y # y refers to the global\n       end;\n\njulia> foo()\n4\n\njulia> x\n1An explicit global is needed to assign to a global variable:sidebar: Avoiding globals\nAvoiding changing the value of global variables is considered by many to be a programming best-practice. One reason for this is that remotely changing the state of global variables in other modules should be done with care as it makes the local behavior of the program hard to reason about. This is why the scope blocks that introduce local scope require the global keyword to declare the intent to modify a global variable.julia> x = 1;\n\njulia> function foobar()\n           global x = 2\n       end;\n\njulia> foobar();\n\njulia> x\n2Note that nested functions can modify their parent scope\'s local variables:julia> x, y = 1, 2;\n\njulia> function baz()\n           x = 2 # introduces a new local\n           function bar()\n               x = 10       # modifies the parent\'s x\n               return x + y # y is global\n           end\n           return bar() + x # 12 + 10 (x is modified in call of bar())\n       end;\n\njulia> baz()\n22\n\njulia> x, y # verify that global x and y are unchanged\n(1, 2)The reason to allow modifying local variables of parent scopes in nested functions is to allow constructing closures which have a private state, for instance the state variable in the following example:julia> let state = 0\n           global counter() = (state += 1)\n       end;\n\njulia> counter()\n1\n\njulia> counter()\n2See also the closures in the examples in the next two sections. A variable such as x in the first example and state in the second that is inherited from the enclosing scope by the inner function is sometimes called a captured variable. Captured variables can present performance challenges discussed in performance tips.The distinction between inheriting global scope and nesting local scope can lead to some slight differences between functions defined in local vs. global scopes for variable assignments. Consider the modification of the last example by moving bar to the global scope:julia> x, y = 1, 2;\n\njulia> function bar()\n           x = 10 # local, no longer a closure variable\n           return x + y\n       end;\n\njulia> function quz()\n           x = 2 # local\n           return bar() + x # 12 + 2 (x is not modified)\n       end;\n\njulia> quz()\n14\n\njulia> x, y # verify that global x and y are unchanged\n(1, 2)Note that the above nesting rules do not pertain to type and macro definitions as they can only appear at the global scope. There are special scoping rules concerning the evaluation of default and keyword function arguments which are described in the Function section.An assignment introducing a variable used inside a function, type or macro definition need not come before its inner usage:julia> f = y -> y + a;\n\njulia> f(3)\nERROR: UndefVarError: a not defined\nStacktrace:\n[...]\n\njulia> a = 1\n1\n\njulia> f(3)\n4This behavior may seem slightly odd for a normal variable, but allows for named functions – which are just normal variables holding function objects – to be used before they are defined. This allows functions to be defined in whatever order is intuitive and convenient, rather than forcing bottom up ordering or requiring forward declarations, as long as they are defined by the time they are actually called. As an example, here is an inefficient, mutually recursive way to test if positive integers are even or odd:julia> even(n) = (n == 0) ? true : odd(n - 1);\n\njulia> odd(n) = (n == 0) ? false : even(n - 1);\n\njulia> even(3)\nfalse\n\njulia> odd(3)\ntrueJulia provides built-in, efficient functions to test for oddness and evenness called iseven and isodd so the above definitions should only be considered to be examples of scope, not efficient design."

    "text": "Unlike assignments to local variables, let statements allocate new variable bindings each time they run. An assignment modifies an existing value location, and let creates new locations. This difference is usually not important, and is only detectable in the case of variables that outlive their scope via closures. The let syntax accepts a comma-separated series of assignments and variable names:julia> x, y, z = -1, -1, -1;\n\njulia> let x = 1, z\n           println(\"x: $x, y: $y\") # x is local variable, y the global\n           println(\"z: $z\") # errors as z has not been assigned yet but is local\n       end\nx: 1, y: -1\nERROR: UndefVarError: z not definedThe assignments are evaluated in order, with each right-hand side evaluated in the scope before the new variable on the left-hand side has been introduced. Therefore it makes sense to write something like let x = x since the two x variables are distinct and have separate storage. Here is an example where the behavior of let is needed:julia> Fs = Vector{Any}(undef, 2); i = 1;\n\njulia> while i <= 2\n           Fs[i] = ()->i\n           global i += 1\n       end\n\njulia> Fs[1]()\n3\n\njulia> Fs[2]()\n3Here we create and store two closures that return variable i. However, it is always the same variable i, so the two closures behave identically. We can use let to create a new binding for i:julia> Fs = Vector{Any}(undef, 2); i = 1;\n\njulia> while i <= 2\n           let i = i\n               Fs[i] = ()->i\n           end\n           global i += 1\n       end\n\njulia> Fs[1]()\n1\n\njulia> Fs[2]()\n2Since the begin construct does not introduce a new scope, it can be useful to use a zero-argument let to just introduce a new scope block without creating any new bindings:julia> let\n           local x = 1\n           let\n               local x = 2\n           end\n           x\n       end\n1Since let introduces a new scope block, the inner local x is a different variable than the outer local x."

It is difficult for the compiler to optimize code involving global variables, since their values (or even their types) might change at almost any time. If a global variable will not change, adding a const declaration solves this performance problem.Local constants are quite different. The compiler is able to determine automatically when a local variable is constant, so local constant declarations are not necessary, and in fact are currently not supported.Special top-level assignments, such as those performed by the function and struct keywords, are constant by default.Note that const only affects the variable binding; the variable may be bound to a mutable object (such as an array), and that object may still be modified. Additionally when one tries to assign a value a variable that is declared constant the following scenarios are possible:if a new value has a different type than the type of the constant then an error is thrown:julia> const x = 1.0\n1.0\n\njulia> x = 1\nERROR: invalid redefinition of constant xif a new value has the same type as the constant then a warning is printed:julia> const y = 1.0\n1.0\n\njulia> y = 2.0\nWARNING: redefining constant y\n2.0if an assignment would not result in the change of variable value no message is given:julia> const z = 100\n100\n\njulia> z = 100\n100The last rule applies for immutable objects even if the vairable binding would change, e.g.:julia> const s1 = \"1\"\n\"1\"\n\njulia> s2 = \"1\"\n\"1\"\n\njulia> pointer.([s1, s2], 1)\n2-element Array{Ptr{UInt8},1}:\n Ptr{UInt8} @0x00000000132c9638\n Ptr{UInt8} @0x0000000013dd3d18\n\njulia> s1 = s2\n\"1\"\n\njulia> pointer.([s1, s2], 1)\n2-element Array{Ptr{UInt8},1}:\n Ptr{UInt8} @0x0000000013dd3d18\n Ptr{UInt8} @0x0000000013dd3d18However, for mutable objects the warning is printed as expected:julia> const a = [1]\n1-element Array{Int64,1}:\n 1\n\njulia> a = [1]\nWARNING: redefining constant a\n1-element Array{Int64,1}:\n 1Note that although possible, changing the value of a variable that is declared as constant is strongly discouraged.

    "text": "Type systems have traditionally fallen into two quite different camps: static type systems, where every program expression must have a type computable before the execution of the program, and dynamic type systems, where nothing is known about types until run time, when the actual values manipulated by the program are available. Object orientation allows some flexibility in statically typed languages by letting code be written without the precise types of values being known at compile time. The ability to write code that can operate on different types is called polymorphism. All code in classic dynamically typed languages is polymorphic: only by explicitly checking types, or when objects fail to support operations at run-time, are the types of any values ever restricted.Julia\'s type system is dynamic, but gains some of the advantages of static type systems by making it possible to indicate that certain values are of specific types. This can be of great assistance in generating efficient code, but even more significantly, it allows method dispatch on the types of function arguments to be deeply integrated with the language. Method dispatch is explored in detail in Methods, but is rooted in the type system presented here.The default behavior in Julia when types are omitted is to allow values to be of any type. Thus, one can write many useful Julia functions without ever explicitly using types. When additional expressiveness is needed, however, it is easy to gradually introduce explicit type annotations into previously \"untyped\" code. Adding annotations serves three primary purposes: to take advantage of Julia\'s powerful multiple-dispatch mechanism,  to improve human readability, and to catch programmer errors.Describing Julia in the lingo of type systems, it is: dynamic, nominative and parametric. Generic types can be parameterized, and the hierarchical relationships between types are explicitly declared, rather than implied by compatible structure. One particularly distinctive feature of Julia\'s type system is that concrete types may not subtype each other: all concrete types are final and may only have abstract types as their supertypes. While this might at first seem unduly restrictive, it has many beneficial consequences with surprisingly few drawbacks. It turns out that being able to inherit behavior is much more important than being able to inherit structure, and inheriting both causes significant difficulties in traditional object-oriented languages. Other high-level aspects of Julia\'s type system that should be mentioned up front are:There is no division between object and non-object values: all values in Julia are true objects having a type that belongs to a single, fully connected type graph, all nodes of which are equally first-class as types.\nThere is no meaningful concept of a \"compile-time type\": the only type a value has is its actual type when the program is running. This is called a \"run-time type\" in object-oriented languages where the combination of static compilation with polymorphism makes this distinction significant.\nOnly values, not variables, have types – variables are simply names bound to values.\nBoth abstract and concrete types can be parameterized by other types. They can also be parameterized by symbols, by values of any type for which isbits returns true (essentially, things like numbers and bools that are stored like C types or structs with no pointers to other objects), and also by tuples thereof. Type parameters may be omitted when they do not need to be referenced or restricted.Julia\'s type system is designed to be powerful and expressive, yet clear, intuitive and unobtrusive. Many Julia programmers may never feel the need to write code that explicitly uses types. Some kinds of programming, however, become clearer, simpler, faster and more robust with declared types."

There are two primary reasons to do this:As an assertion to help confirm that your program works the way you expect,\nTo provide extra type information to the compiler, which can then improve performance in some casesWhen appended to an expression computing a value, the :: operator is read as \"is an instance of\". It can be used anywhere to assert that the value of the expression on the left is an instance of the type on the right. When the type on the right is concrete, the value on the left must have that type as its implementation – recall that all concrete types are final, so no implementation is a subtype of any other. When the type is abstract, it suffices for the value to be implemented by a concrete type that is a subtype of the abstract type.

Every value assigned to the variable will be converted to the declared type using convert:julia> function foo()\n           x::Int8 = 100\n           x\n       end\nfoo (generic function with 1 method)\n\njulia> foo()\n100\n\njulia> typeof(ans)\nInt8This feature is useful for avoiding performance \"gotchas\" that could occur if one of the assignments to a variable changed its type unexpectedly.This \"declaration\" behavior only occurs in specific contexts:local x::Int8  # in a local declaration\nx::Int8 = 10   # as the left-hand side of an assignmentand applies to the whole current scope, even before the declaration. Currently, type declarations cannot be used in global scope, e.g. in the REPL, since Julia does not yet have constant-type globals.Declarations can also be attached to function definitions:function sinc(x)::Float64\n    if x == 0\n        return 1\n    end\n    return sin(pi*x)/(pi*x)\nendReturning from this function behaves just like an assignment to a variable with a declared type: the value is always converted to Float64."

    "category": "section",
    "text": "Abstract types cannot be instantiated, and serve only as nodes in the type graph, thereby describing sets of related concrete types: those concrete types which are their descendants. We begin with abstract types even though they have no instantiation because they are the backbone of the type system: they form the conceptual hierarchy which makes Julia\'s type system more than just a collection of object implementations.Recall that in Integers and Floating-Point Numbers, we introduced a variety of concrete types of numeric values: Int8, UInt8, Int16, UInt16, Int32, UInt32, Int64, UInt64, Int128, UInt128, Float16, Float32, and Float64. Although they have different representation sizes, Int8, Int16, Int32, Int64 and Int128 all have in common that they are signed integer types. Likewise UInt8, UInt16, UInt32, UInt64 and UInt128 are all unsigned integer types, while Float16, Float32 and Float64 are distinct in being floating-point types rather than integers. It is common for a piece of code to make sense, for example, only if its arguments are some kind of integer, but not really depend on what particular kind of integer. For example, the greatest common denominator algorithm works for all kinds of integers, but will not work for floating-point numbers. Abstract types allow the construction of a hierarchy of types, providing a context into which concrete types can fit. This allows you, for example, to easily program to any type that is an integer, without restricting an algorithm to a specific type of integer.Abstract types are declared using the abstract type keyword. The general syntaxes for declaring an abstract type are:abstract type «name» end\nabstract type «name» <: «supertype» endThe abstract type keyword introduces a new abstract type, whose name is given by «name». This name can be optionally followed by <: and an already-existing type, indicating that the newly declared abstract type is a subtype of this \"parent\" type.When no supertype is given, the default supertype is Any – a predefined abstract type that all objects are instances of and all types are subtypes of. In type theory, Any is commonly called \"top\" because it is at the apex of the type graph. Julia also has a predefined abstract \"bottom\" type, at the nadir of the type graph, which is written as Union{}. It is the exact opposite of Any: no object is an instance of Union{} and all types are supertypes of Union{}.Let\'s consider some of the abstract types that make up Julia\'s numerical hierarchy:abstract type Number end\nabstract type Real     <: Number end\nabstract type AbstractFloat <: Real end\nabstract type Integer  <: Real end\nabstract type Signed   <: Integer end\nabstract type Unsigned <: Integer endThe Number type is a direct child type of Any, and Real is its child. In turn, Real has two children (it has more, but only two are shown here; we\'ll get to the others later): Integer and AbstractFloat, separating the world into representations of integers and representations of real numbers. Representations of real numbers include, of course, floating-point types, but also include other types, such as rationals. Hence, AbstractFloat is a proper subtype of Real, including only floating-point representations of real numbers. Integers are further subdivided into Signed and Unsigned varieties.The <: operator in general means \"is a subtype of\", and, used in declarations like this, declares the right-hand type to be an immediate supertype of the newly declared type. It can also be used in expressions as a subtype operator which returns true when its left operand is a subtype of its right operand:julia> Integer <: Number\ntrue\n\njulia> Integer <: AbstractFloat\nfalseAn important use of abstract types is to provide default implementations for concrete types. To give a simple example, consider:function myplus(x,y)\n    x+y\nendThe first thing to note is that the above argument declarations are equivalent to x::Any and y::Any. When this function is invoked, say as myplus(2,5), the dispatcher chooses the most specific method named myplus that matches the given arguments. (See Methods for more information on multiple dispatch.)Assuming no method more specific than the above is found, Julia next internally defines and compiles a method called myplus specifically for two Int arguments based on the generic function given above, i.e., it implicitly defines and compiles:function myplus(x::Int,y::Int)\n    x+y\nendand finally, it invokes this specific method.Thus, abstract types allow programmers to write generic functions that can later be used as the default method by many combinations of concrete types. Thanks to multiple dispatch, the programmer has full control over whether the default or more specific method is used.An important point to note is that there is no loss in performance if the programmer relies on a function whose arguments are abstract types, because it is recompiled for each tuple of argument concrete types with which it is invoked. (There may be a performance issue, however, in the case of function arguments that are containers of abstract types; see Performance Tips.)"

    "text": "A primitive type is a concrete type whose data consists of plain old bits. Classic examples of primitive types are integers and floating-point values. Unlike most languages, Julia lets you declare your own primitive types, rather than providing only a fixed set of built-in ones. In fact, the standard primitive types are all defined in the language itself:primitive type Float16 <: AbstractFloat 16 end\nprimitive type Float32 <: AbstractFloat 32 end\nprimitive type Float64 <: AbstractFloat 64 end\n\nprimitive type Bool <: Integer 8 end\nprimitive type Char <: AbstractChar 32 end\n\nprimitive type Int8    <: Signed   8 end\nprimitive type UInt8   <: Unsigned 8 end\nprimitive type Int16   <: Signed   16 end\nprimitive type UInt16  <: Unsigned 16 end\nprimitive type Int32   <: Signed   32 end\nprimitive type UInt32  <: Unsigned 32 end\nprimitive type Int64   <: Signed   64 end\nprimitive type UInt64  <: Unsigned 64 end\nprimitive type Int128  <: Signed   128 end\nprimitive type UInt128 <: Unsigned 128 endThe general syntaxes for declaring a primitive type are:primitive type «name» «bits» end\nprimitive type «name» <: «supertype» «bits» endThe number of bits indicates how much storage the type requires and the name gives the new type a name. A primitive type can optionally be declared to be a subtype of some supertype. If a supertype is omitted, then the type defaults to having Any as its immediate supertype. The declaration of Bool above therefore means that a boolean value takes eight bits to store, and has Integer as its immediate supertype. Currently, only sizes that are multiples of 8 bits are supported. Therefore, boolean values, although they really need just a single bit, cannot be declared to be any smaller than eight bits.The types Bool, Int8 and UInt8 all have identical representations: they are eight-bit chunks of memory. Since Julia\'s type system is nominative, however, they are not interchangeable despite having identical structure. A fundamental difference between them is that they have different supertypes: Bool\'s direct supertype is Integer, Int8\'s is Signed, and UInt8\'s is Unsigned. All other differences between Bool, Int8, and UInt8 are matters of behavior – the way functions are defined to act when given objects of these types as arguments. This is why a nominative type system is necessary: if structure determined type, which in turn dictates behavior, then it would be impossible to make Bool behave any differently than Int8 or UInt8."

    "category": "section",
    "text": "Composite types are called records, structs, or objects in various languages. A composite type is a collection of named fields, an instance of which can be treated as a single value. In many languages, composite types are the only kind of user-definable type, and they are by far the most commonly used user-defined type in Julia as well.In mainstream object oriented languages, such as C++, Java, Python and Ruby, composite types also have named functions associated with them, and the combination is called an \"object\". In purer object-oriented languages, such as Ruby or Smalltalk, all values are objects whether they are composites or not. In less pure object oriented languages, including C++ and Java, some values, such as integers and floating-point values, are not objects, while instances of user-defined composite types are true objects with associated methods. In Julia, all values are objects, but functions are not bundled with the objects they operate on. This is necessary since Julia chooses which method of a function to use by multiple dispatch, meaning that the types of all of a function\'s arguments are considered when selecting a method, rather than just the first one (see Methods for more information on methods and dispatch). Thus, it would be inappropriate for functions to \"belong\" to only their first argument. Organizing methods into function objects rather than having named bags of methods \"inside\" each object ends up being a highly beneficial aspect of the language design.Composite types are introduced with the struct keyword followed by a block of field names, optionally annotated with types using the :: operator:julia> struct Foo\n           bar\n           baz::Int\n           qux::Float64\n       endFields with no type annotation default to Any, and can accordingly hold any type of value.New objects of type Foo are created by applying the Foo type object like a function to values for its fields:julia> foo = Foo(\"Hello, world.\", 23, 1.5)\nFoo(\"Hello, world.\", 23, 1.5)\n\njulia> typeof(foo)\nFooWhen a type is applied like a function it is called a constructor. Two constructors are generated automatically (these are called default constructors). One accepts any arguments and calls convert to convert them to the types of the fields, and the other accepts arguments that match the field types exactly. The reason both of these are generated is that this makes it easier to add new definitions without inadvertently replacing a default constructor.Since the bar field is unconstrained in type, any value will do. However, the value for baz must be convertible to Int:julia> Foo((), 23.5, 1)\nERROR: InexactError: Int64(Int64, 23.5)\nStacktrace:\n[...]You may find a list of field names using the fieldnames function.julia> fieldnames(Foo)\n(:bar, :baz, :qux)You can access the field values of a composite object using the traditional foo.bar notation:julia> foo.bar\n\"Hello, world.\"\n\njulia> foo.baz\n23\n\njulia> foo.qux\n1.5Composite objects declared with struct are immutable; they cannot be modified after construction. This may seem odd at first, but it has several advantages:It can be more efficient. Some structs can be packed efficiently into arrays, and in some cases the compiler is able to avoid allocating immutable objects entirely.\nIt is not possible to violate the invariants provided by the type\'s constructors.\nCode using immutable objects can be easier to reason about.An immutable object might contain mutable objects, such as arrays, as fields. Those contained objects will remain mutable; only the fields of the immutable object itself cannot be changed to point to different objects.Where required, mutable composite objects can be declared with the keyword mutable struct, to be discussed in the next section.Immutable composite types with no fields are singletons; there can be only one instance of such types:julia> struct NoFields\n       end\n\njulia> NoFields() === NoFields()\ntrueThe === function confirms that the \"two\" constructed instances of NoFields are actually one and the same. Singleton types are described in further detail below.There is much more to say about how instances of composite types are created, but that discussion depends on both Parametric Types and on Methods, and is sufficiently important to be addressed in its own section: Constructors."

A mutable object is like a little container that might hold different values over time, and so can only be reliably identified with its address. In contrast, an instance of an immutable type is associated with specific field values –- the field values alone tell you everything about the object. In deciding whether to make a type mutable, ask whether two instances with the same field values would be considered identical, or if they might need to change independently over time. If they would be considered identical, the type should probably be immutable.To recap, two essential properties define immutability in Julia:It is not permitted to modify the value of an immutable type.\nFor bits types this means that the bit pattern of a value once set will never change and that value is the identity of a bits type.\nFor composite  types, this means that the identity of the values of its fields will never change. When the fields are bits types, that means their bits will never change, for fields whose values are mutable types like arrays, that means the fields will always refer to the same mutable value even though that mutable value\'s content may itself be modified.\nAn object with an immutable type may be copied freely by the compiler since its immutability makes it impossible to programmatically distinguish between the original object and a copy.\nIn particular, this means that small enough immutable values like integers and floats are typically passed to functions in registers (or stack allocated).\nMutable values, on the other hand are heap-allocated and passed to functions as pointers to heap-allocated values except in cases where the compiler is sure that there\'s no way to tell that this is not what is happening."

This pattern is the Julia equivalent of Nullable, Option or Maybe types in other languages.

    "text": "An important and powerful feature of Julia\'s type system is that it is parametric: types can take parameters, so that type declarations actually introduce a whole family of new types – one for each possible combination of parameter values. There are many languages that support some version of generic programming, wherein data structures and algorithms to manipulate them may be specified without specifying the exact types involved. For example, some form of generic programming exists in ML, Haskell, Ada, Eiffel, C++, Java, C#, F#, and Scala, just to name a few. Some of these languages support true parametric polymorphism (e.g. ML, Haskell, Scala), while others support ad-hoc, template-based styles of generic programming (e.g. C++, Java). With so many different varieties of generic programming and parametric types in various languages, we won\'t even attempt to compare Julia\'s parametric types to other languages, but will instead focus on explaining Julia\'s system in its own right. We will note, however, that because Julia is a dynamically typed language and doesn\'t need to make all type decisions at compile time, many traditional difficulties encountered in static parametric type systems can be relatively easily handled.All declared types (the DataType variety) can be parameterized, with the same syntax in each case. We will discuss them in the following order: first, parametric composite types, then parametric abstract types, and finally parametric primitive types."

What, one may ask, is T? Well, that\'s precisely the point of parametric types: it can be any type at all (or a value of any bits type, actually, although here it\'s clearly used as a type). Point{Float64} is a concrete type equivalent to the type defined by replacing T in the definition of Point with Float64. Thus, this single declaration actually declares an unlimited number of types: Point{Float64}, Point{AbstractString}, Point{Int64}, etc. Each of these is now a usable concrete type:julia> Point{Float64}\nPoint{Float64}\n\njulia> Point{AbstractString}\nPoint{AbstractString}The type Point{Float64} is a point whose coordinates are 64-bit floating-point values, while the type Point{AbstractString} is a \"point\" whose \"coordinates\" are string objects (see Strings).Point itself is also a valid type object, containing all instances Point{Float64}, Point{AbstractString}, etc. as subtypes:julia> Point{Float64} <: Point\ntrue\n\njulia> Point{AbstractString} <: Point\ntrueOther types, of course, are not subtypes of it:julia> Float64 <: Point\nfalse\n\njulia> AbstractString <: Point\nfalseConcrete Point types with different values of T are never subtypes of each other:julia> Point{Float64} <: Point{Int64}\nfalse\n\njulia> Point{Float64} <: Point{Real}\nfalsewarning: Warning\nThis last point is very important: even though Float64 <: Real we DO NOT have Point{Float64} <: Point{Real}.In other words, in the parlance of type theory, Julia\'s type parameters are invariant, rather than being covariant (or even contravariant). This is for practical reasons: while any instance of Point{Float64} may conceptually be like an instance of Point{Real} as well, the two types have different representations in memory:An instance of Point{Float64} can be represented compactly and efficiently as an immediate pair of 64-bit values;\nAn instance of Point{Real} must be able to hold any pair of instances of Real. Since objects that are instances of Real can be of arbitrary size and structure, in practice an instance of Point{Real} must be represented as a pair of pointers to individually allocated Real objects.The efficiency gained by being able to store Point{Float64} objects with immediate values is magnified enormously in the case of arrays: an Array{Float64} can be stored as a contiguous memory block of 64-bit floating-point values, whereas an Array{Real} must be an array of pointers to individually allocated Real objects – which may well be boxed 64-bit floating-point values, but also might be arbitrarily large, complex objects, which are declared to be implementations of the Real abstract type.Since Point{Float64} is not a subtype of Point{Real}, the following method can\'t be applied to arguments of type Point{Float64}:function norm(p::Point{Real})\n    sqrt(p.x^2 + p.y^2)\nendA correct way to define a method that accepts all arguments of type Point{T} where T is a subtype of Real is:function norm(p::Point{<:Real})\n    sqrt(p.x^2 + p.y^2)\nend(Equivalently, one could define function norm(p::Point{T} where T<:Real) or function norm(p::Point{T}) where T<:Real; see UnionAll Types.)More examples will be discussed later in Methods.How does one construct a Point object? It is possible to define custom constructors for composite types, which will be discussed in detail in Constructors, but in the absence of any special constructor declarations, there are two default ways of creating new composite objects, one in which the type parameters are explicitly given and the other in which they are implied by the arguments to the object constructor.Since the type Point{Float64} is a concrete type equivalent to Point declared with Float64 in place of T, it can be applied as a constructor accordingly:julia> Point{Float64}(1.0, 2.0)\nPoint{Float64}(1.0, 2.0)\n\njulia> typeof(ans)\nPoint{Float64}For the default constructor, exactly one argument must be supplied for each field:julia> Point{Float64}(1.0)\nERROR: MethodError: no method matching Point{Float64}(::Float64)\n[...]\n\njulia> Point{Float64}(1.0,2.0,3.0)\nERROR: MethodError: no method matching Point{Float64}(::Float64, ::Float64, ::Float64)\n[...]Only one default constructor is generated for parametric types, since overriding it is not possible. This constructor accepts any arguments and converts them to the field types.In many cases, it is redundant to provide the type of Point object one wants to construct, since the types of arguments to the constructor call already implicitly provide type information. For that reason, you can also apply Point itself as a constructor, provided that the implied value of the parameter type T is unambiguous:julia> Point(1.0,2.0)\nPoint{Float64}(1.0, 2.0)\n\njulia> typeof(ans)\nPoint{Float64}\n\njulia> Point(1,2)\nPoint{Int64}(1, 2)\n\njulia> typeof(ans)\nPoint{Int64}In the case of Point, the type of T is unambiguously implied if and only if the two arguments to Point have the same type. When this isn\'t the case, the constructor will fail with a MethodError:julia> Point(1,2.5)\nERROR: MethodError: no method matching Point(::Int64, ::Float64)\nClosest candidates are:\n  Point(::T, !Matched::T) where T at none:2Constructor methods to appropriately handle such mixed cases can be defined, but that will not be discussed until later on in Constructors."

This is useful for writing methods (especially parametric ones) whose behavior depends on a type that is given as an explicit argument rather than implied by the type of one of its arguments.A few popular languages have singleton types, including Haskell, Scala and Ruby. In general usage, the term \"singleton type\" refers to a type whose only instance is a single value. This meaning applies to Julia\'s singleton types, but with that caveat that only type objects have singleton types."

Thus, Ptr{Float64} and Ptr{Int64} are distinct types, even though they have identical representations.

    "category": "section",
    "text": "We have said that a parametric type like Ptr acts as a supertype of all its instances (Ptr{Int64} etc.). How does this work? Ptr itself cannot be a normal data type, since without knowing the type of the referenced data the type clearly cannot be used for memory operations. The answer is that Ptr (or other parametric types like Array) is a different kind of type called a UnionAll type. Such a type expresses the iterated union of types for all values of some parameter.UnionAll types are usually written using the keyword where. For example Ptr could be more accurately written as Ptr{T} where T, meaning all values whose type is Ptr{T} for some value of T. In this context, the parameter T is also often called a \"type variable\" since it is like a variable that ranges over types. Each where introduces a single type variable, so these expressions are nested for types with multiple parameters, for example Array{T,N} where N where T.The type application syntax A{B,C} requires A to be a UnionAll type, and first substitutes B for the outermost type variable in A. The result is expected to be another UnionAll type, into which C is then substituted. So A{B,C} is equivalent to A{B}{C}. This explains why it is possible to partially instantiate a type, as in Array{Float64}: the first parameter value has been fixed, but the second still ranges over all possible values. Using explicit where syntax, any subset of parameters can be fixed. For example, the type of all 1-dimensional arrays can be written as Array{T,1} where T.Type variables can be restricted with subtype relations. Array{T} where T<:Integer refers to all arrays whose element type is some kind of Integer. The syntax Array{<:Integer} is a convenient shorthand for Array{T} where T<:Integer. Type variables can have both lower and upper bounds. Array{T} where Int<:T<:Number refers to all arrays of Numbers that are able to contain Ints (since T must be at least as big as Int). The syntax where T>:Int also works to specify only the lower bound of a type variable, and Array{>:Int} is equivalent to Array{T} where T>:Int.Since where expressions nest, type variable bounds can refer to outer type variables. For example Tuple{T,Array{S}} where S<:AbstractArray{T} where T<:Real refers to 2-tuples whose first element is some Real, and whose second element is an Array of any kind of array whose element type contains the type of the first tuple element.The where keyword itself can be nested inside a more complex declaration. For example, consider the two types created by the following declarations:julia> const T1 = Array{Array{T,1} where T, 1}\nArray{Array{T,1} where T,1}\n\njulia> const T2 = Array{Array{T,1}, 1} where T\nArray{Array{T,1},1} where TType T1 defines a 1-dimensional array of 1-dimensional arrays; each of the inner arrays consists of objects of the same type, but this type may vary from one inner array to the next. On the other hand, type T2 defines a 1-dimensional array of 1-dimensional arrays all of whose inner arrays must have the same type.  Note that T2 is an abstract type, e.g., Array{Array{Int,1},1} <: T2, whereas T1 is a concrete type. As a consequence, T1 can be constructed with a zero-argument constructor a=T1() but T2 cannot.There is a convenient syntax for naming such types, similar to the short form of function definition syntax:Vector{T} = Array{T,1}This is equivalent to const Vector = Array{T,1} where T. Writing Vector{Float64} is equivalent to writing Array{Float64,1}, and the umbrella type Vector has as instances all Array objects where the second parameter – the number of array dimensions – is 1, regardless of what the element type is. In languages where parametric types must always be specified in full, this is not especially helpful, but in Julia, this allows one to write just Vector for the abstract type including all one-dimensional dense arrays of any element type."

    "text": "Often, one wants to customize how instances of a type are displayed.  This is accomplished by overloading the show function.  For example, suppose we define a type to represent complex numbers in polar form:julia> struct Polar{T<:Real} <: Number\n           r::T\n           Θ::T\n       end\n\njulia> Polar(r::Real,Θ::Real) = Polar(promote(r,Θ)...)\nPolarHere, we\'ve added a custom constructor function so that it can take arguments of different Real types and promote them to a common type (see Constructors and Conversion and Promotion). (Of course, we would have to define lots of other methods, too, to make it act like a Number, e.g. +, *, one, zero, promotion rules and so on.) By default, instances of this type display rather simply, with information about the type name and the field values, as e.g. Polar{Float64}(3.0,4.0).If we want it to display instead as 3.0 * exp(4.0im), we would define the following method to print the object to a given output object io (representing a file, terminal, buffer, etcetera; see Networking and Streams):julia> Base.show(io::IO, z::Polar) = print(io, z.r, \" * exp(\", z.Θ, \"im)\")More fine-grained control over display of Polar objects is possible. In particular, sometimes one wants both a verbose multi-line printing format, used for displaying a single object in the REPL and other interactive environments, and also a more compact single-line format used for print or for displaying the object as part of another object (e.g. in an array). Although by default the show(io, z) function is called in both cases, you can define a different multi-line format for displaying an object by overloading a three-argument form of show that takes the text/plain MIME type as its second argument (see Multimedia I/O), for example:julia> Base.show(io::IO, ::MIME\"text/plain\", z::Polar{T}) where{T} =\n           print(io, \"Polar{$T} complex number:\\n   \", z)(Note that print(..., z) here will call the 2-argument show(io, z) method.) This results in:julia> Polar(3, 4.0)\nPolar{Float64} complex number:\n   3.0 * exp(4.0im)\n\njulia> [Polar(3, 4.0), Polar(4.0,5.3)]\n2-element Array{Polar{Float64},1}:\n 3.0 * exp(4.0im)\n 4.0 * exp(5.3im)where the single-line show(io, z) form is still used for an array of Polar values.   Technically, the REPL calls display(z) to display the result of executing a line, which defaults to show(stdout, MIME(\"text/plain\"), z), which in turn defaults to show(stdout, z), but you should not define new display methods unless you are defining a new multimedia display handler (see Multimedia I/O).Moreover, you can also define show methods for other MIME types in order to enable richer display (HTML, images, etcetera) of objects in environments that support this (e.g. IJulia).   For example, we can define formatted HTML display of Polar objects, with superscripts and italics, via:julia> Base.show(io::IO, ::MIME\"text/html\", z::Polar{T}) where {T} =\n           println(io, \"<code>Polar{$T}</code> complex number: \",\n                   z.r, \" <i>e</i><sup>\", z.Θ, \" <i>i</i></sup>\")A Polar object will then display automatically using HTML in an environment that supports HTML display, but you can call show manually to get HTML output if you want:julia> show(stdout, \"text/html\", Polar(3.0,4.0))\n<code>Polar{Float64}</code> complex number: 3.0 <i>e</i><sup>4.0 <i>i</i></sup><p>An HTML renderer would display this as: <code>Polar{Float64}</code> complex number: 3.0 <i>e</i><sup>4.0 <i>i</i></sup></p>As a rule of thumb, the single-line show method should print a valid Julia expression for creating the shown object.  When this show method contains infix operators, such as the multiplication operator (*) in our single-line show method for Polar above, it may not parse correctly when printed as part of another object.  To see this, consider the expression object (see Program representation) which takes the square of a specific instance of our Polar type:julia> a = Polar(3, 4.0)\nPolar{Float64} complex number:\n   3.0 * exp(4.0im)\n\njulia> print(:($a^2))\n3.0 * exp(4.0im) ^ 2Because the operator ^ has higher precedence than * (see Operator Precedence and Associativity), this output does not faithfully represent the expression a ^ 2 which should be equal to (3.0 * exp(4.0im)) ^ 2.  To solve this issue, we must make a custom method for Base.show_unquoted(io::IO, z::Polar, indent::Int, precedence::Int), which is called internally by the expression object when printing:julia> function Base.show_unquoted(io::IO, z::Polar, ::Int, precedence::Int)\n           if Base.operator_precedence(:*) <= precedence\n               print(io, \"(\")\n               show(io, z)\n               print(io, \")\")\n           else\n               show(io, z)\n           end\n       end\n\njulia> :($a^2)\n:((3.0 * exp(4.0im)) ^ 2)The method defined above adds parentheses around the call to show when the precedence of the calling operator is higher than or equal to the precedence of multiplication.  This check allows expressions which parse correctly without the parentheses (such as :($a + 2) and :($a == 2)) to omit them when printing:julia> :($a + 2)\n:(3.0 * exp(4.0im) + 2)\n\njulia> :($a == 2)\n:(3.0 * exp(4.0im) == 2)In some cases, it is useful to adjust the behavior of show methods depending on the context. This can be achieved via the IOContext type, which allows passing contextual properties together with a wrapped IO stream. For example, we can build a shorter representation in our show method when the :compact property is set to true, falling back to the long representation if the property is false or absent:julia> function Base.show(io::IO, z::Polar)\n           if get(io, :compact, false)\n               print(io, z.r, \"ℯ\", z.Θ, \"im\")\n           else\n               print(io, z.r, \" * exp(\", z.Θ, \"im)\")\n           end\n       endThis new compact representation will be used when the passed IO stream is an IOContext object with the :compact property set. In particular, this is the case when printing arrays with multiple columns (where horizontal space is limited):julia> show(IOContext(stdout, :compact=>true), Polar(3, 4.0))\n3.0ℯ4.0im\n\njulia> [Polar(3, 4.0) Polar(4.0,5.3)]\n1×2 Array{Polar{Float64},2}:\n 3.0ℯ4.0im  4.0ℯ5.3imSee the IOContext documentation for a list of common properties which can be used to adjust printing."

A common example is the dimensionality parameter in Array{T,N}, where T is a type (e.g., Float64) but N is just an Int.You can create your own custom types that take values as parameters, and use them to control dispatch of custom types. By way of illustration of this idea, let\'s introduce a parametric type, Val{x}, and a constructor Val(x) = Val{x}(), which serves as a customary way to exploit this technique for cases where you don\'t need a more elaborate hierarchy.Val is defined as:julia> struct Val{x}\n       end\n\njulia> Val(x) = Val{x}()\nValThere is no more to the implementation of Val than this.

    "text": "Recall from Functions that a function is an object that maps a tuple of arguments to a return value, or throws an exception if no appropriate value can be returned. It is common for the same conceptual function or operation to be implemented quite differently for different types of arguments: adding two integers is very different from adding two floating-point numbers, both of which are distinct from adding an integer to a floating-point number. Despite their implementation differences, these operations all fall under the general concept of \"addition\". Accordingly, in Julia, these behaviors all belong to a single object: the + function.To facilitate using many different implementations of the same concept smoothly, functions need not be defined all at once, but can rather be defined piecewise by providing specific behaviors for certain combinations of argument types and counts. A definition of one possible behavior for a function is called a method. Thus far, we have presented only examples of functions defined with a single method, applicable to all types of arguments. However, the signatures of method definitions can be annotated to indicate the types of arguments in addition to their number, and more than a single method definition may be provided. When a function is applied to a particular tuple of arguments, the most specific method applicable to those arguments is applied. Thus, the overall behavior of a function is a patchwork of the behaviors of its various method definitions. If the patchwork is well designed, even though the implementations of the methods may be quite different, the outward behavior of the function will appear seamless and consistent.The choice of which method to execute when a function is applied is called dispatch. Julia allows the dispatch process to choose which of a function\'s methods to call based on the number of arguments given, and on the types of all of the function\'s arguments. This is different than traditional object-oriented languages, where dispatch occurs based only on the first argument, which often has a special argument syntax, and is sometimes implied rather than explicitly written as an argument. [1] Using all of a function\'s arguments to choose which method should be invoked, rather than just the first, is known as multiple dispatch. Multiple dispatch is particularly useful for mathematical code, where it makes little sense to artificially deem the operations to \"belong\" to one argument more than any of the others: does the addition operation in x + y belong to x any more than it does to y? The implementation of a mathematical operator generally depends on the types of all of its arguments. Even beyond mathematical operations, however, multiple dispatch ends up being a powerful and convenient paradigm for structuring and organizing programs.[1]: In C++ or Java, for example, in a method call like obj.meth(arg1,arg2), the object obj \"receives\" the method call and is implicitly passed to the method via the this keyword, rather than as an explicit method argument. When the current this object is the receiver of a method call, it can be omitted altogether, writing just meth(arg1,arg2), with this implied as the receiving object."

    "text": "Until now, we have, in our examples, defined only functions with a single method having unconstrained argument types. Such functions behave just like they would in traditional dynamically typed languages. Nevertheless, we have used multiple dispatch and methods almost continually without being aware of it: all of Julia\'s standard functions and operators, like the aforementioned + function, have many methods defining their behavior over various possible combinations of argument type and count.When defining a function, one can optionally constrain the types of parameters it is applicable to, using the :: type-assertion operator, introduced in the section on Composite Types:julia> f(x::Float64, y::Float64) = 2x + y\nf (generic function with 1 method)This function definition applies only to calls where x and y are both values of type Float64:julia> f(2.0, 3.0)\n7.0Applying it to any other types of arguments will result in a MethodError:julia> f(2.0, 3)\nERROR: MethodError: no method matching f(::Float64, ::Int64)\nClosest candidates are:\n  f(::Float64, !Matched::Float64) at none:1\n\njulia> f(Float32(2.0), 3.0)\nERROR: MethodError: no method matching f(::Float32, ::Float64)\nClosest candidates are:\n  f(!Matched::Float64, ::Float64) at none:1\n\njulia> f(2.0, \"3.0\")\nERROR: MethodError: no method matching f(::Float64, ::String)\nClosest candidates are:\n  f(::Float64, !Matched::Float64) at none:1\n\njulia> f(\"2.0\", \"3.0\")\nERROR: MethodError: no method matching f(::String, ::String)As you can see, the arguments must be precisely of type Float64. Other numeric types, such as integers or 32-bit floating-point values, are not automatically converted to 64-bit floating-point, nor are strings parsed as numbers. Because Float64 is a concrete type and concrete types cannot be subclassed in Julia, such a definition can only be applied to arguments that are exactly of type Float64. It may often be useful, however, to write more general methods where the declared parameter types are abstract:julia> f(x::Number, y::Number) = 2x - y\nf (generic function with 2 methods)\n\njulia> f(2.0, 3)\n1.0This method definition applies to any pair of arguments that are instances of Number. They need not be of the same type, so long as they are each numeric values. The problem of handling disparate numeric types is delegated to the arithmetic operations in the expression 2x - y.To define a function with multiple methods, one simply defines the function multiple times, with different numbers and types of arguments. The first method definition for a function creates the function object, and subsequent method definitions add new methods to the existing function object. The most specific method definition matching the number and types of the arguments will be executed when the function is applied. Thus, the two method definitions above, taken together, define the behavior for f over all pairs of instances of the abstract type Number – but with a different behavior specific to pairs of Float64 values. If one of the arguments is a 64-bit float but the other one is not, then the f(Float64,Float64) method cannot be called and the more general f(Number,Number) method must be used:julia> f(2.0, 3.0)\n7.0\n\njulia> f(2, 3.0)\n1.0\n\njulia> f(2.0, 3)\n1.0\n\njulia> f(2, 3)\n1The 2x + y definition is only used in the first case, while the 2x - y definition is used in the others. No automatic casting or conversion of function arguments is ever performed: all conversion in Julia is non-magical and completely explicit. Conversion and Promotion, however, shows how clever application of sufficiently advanced technology can be indistinguishable from magic. [Clarke61]For non-numeric values, and for fewer or more than two arguments, the function f remains undefined, and applying it will still result in a MethodError:julia> f(\"foo\", 3)\nERROR: MethodError: no method matching f(::String, ::Int64)\nClosest candidates are:\n  f(!Matched::Number, ::Number) at none:1\n\njulia> f()\nERROR: MethodError: no method matching f()\nClosest candidates are:\n  f(!Matched::Float64, !Matched::Float64) at none:1\n  f(!Matched::Number, !Matched::Number) at none:1You can easily see which methods exist for a function by entering the function object itself in an interactive session:julia> f\nf (generic function with 2 methods)This output tells us that f is a function object with two methods. To find out what the signatures of those methods are, use the methods function:julia> methods(f)\n# 2 methods for generic function \"f\":\n[1] f(x::Float64, y::Float64) in Main at none:1\n[2] f(x::Number, y::Number) in Main at none:1which shows that f has two methods, one taking two Float64 arguments and one taking arguments of type Number. It also indicates the file and line number where the methods were defined: because these methods were defined at the REPL, we get the apparent line number none:1.In the absence of a type declaration with ::, the type of a method parameter is Any by default, meaning that it is unconstrained since all values in Julia are instances of the abstract type Any. Thus, we can define a catch-all method for f like so:julia> f(x,y) = println(\"Whoa there, Nelly.\")\nf (generic function with 3 methods)\n\njulia> f(\"foo\", 1)\nWhoa there, Nelly.This catch-all is less specific than any other possible method definition for a pair of parameter values, so it will only be called on pairs of arguments to which no other method definition applies.Although it seems a simple concept, multiple dispatch on the types of values is perhaps the single most powerful and central feature of the Julia language. Core operations typically have dozens of methods:julia> methods(+)\n# 180 methods for generic function \"+\":\n[1] +(x::Bool, z::Complex{Bool}) in Base at complex.jl:227\n[2] +(x::Bool, y::Bool) in Base at bool.jl:89\n[3] +(x::Bool) in Base at bool.jl:86\n[4] +(x::Bool, y::T) where T<:AbstractFloat in Base at bool.jl:96\n[5] +(x::Bool, z::Complex) in Base at complex.jl:234\n[6] +(a::Float16, b::Float16) in Base at float.jl:373\n[7] +(x::Float32, y::Float32) in Base at float.jl:375\n[8] +(x::Float64, y::Float64) in Base at float.jl:376\n[9] +(z::Complex{Bool}, x::Bool) in Base at complex.jl:228\n[10] +(z::Complex{Bool}, x::Real) in Base at complex.jl:242\n[11] +(x::Char, y::Integer) in Base at char.jl:40\n[12] +(c::BigInt, x::BigFloat) in Base.MPFR at mpfr.jl:307\n[13] +(a::BigInt, b::BigInt, c::BigInt, d::BigInt, e::BigInt) in Base.GMP at gmp.jl:392\n[14] +(a::BigInt, b::BigInt, c::BigInt, d::BigInt) in Base.GMP at gmp.jl:391\n[15] +(a::BigInt, b::BigInt, c::BigInt) in Base.GMP at gmp.jl:390\n[16] +(x::BigInt, y::BigInt) in Base.GMP at gmp.jl:361\n[17] +(x::BigInt, c::Union{UInt16, UInt32, UInt64, UInt8}) in Base.GMP at gmp.jl:398\n...\n[180] +(a, b, c, xs...) in Base at operators.jl:424Multiple dispatch together with the flexible parametric type system give Julia its ability to abstractly express high-level algorithms decoupled from implementation details, yet generate efficient, specialized code to handle each case at run time."

Thus, overall, this defines a boolean function that checks whether its two arguments are of the same type:julia> same_type(1, 2)\ntrue\n\njulia> same_type(1, 2.0)\nfalse\n\njulia> same_type(1.0, 2.0)\ntrue\n\njulia> same_type(\"foo\", 2.0)\nfalse\n\njulia> same_type(\"foo\", \"bar\")\ntrue\n\njulia> same_type(Int32(1), Int64(2))\nfalseSuch definitions correspond to methods whose type signatures are UnionAll types (see UnionAll Types).This kind of definition of function behavior by dispatch is quite common – idiomatic, even – in Julia. Method type parameters are not restricted to being used as the types of arguments: they can be used anywhere a value would be in the signature of the function or body of the function. Here\'s an example where the method type parameter T is used as the type parameter to the parametric type Vector{T} in the method signature:julia> myappend(v::Vector{T}, x::T) where {T} = [v..., x]\nmyappend (generic function with 1 method)\n\njulia> myappend([1,2,3],4)\n4-element Array{Int64,1}:\n 1\n 2\n 3\n 4\n\njulia> myappend([1,2,3],2.5)\nERROR: MethodError: no method matching myappend(::Array{Int64,1}, ::Float64)\nClosest candidates are:\n  myappend(::Array{T,1}, !Matched::T) where T at none:1\n\njulia> myappend([1.0,2.0,3.0],4.0)\n4-element Array{Float64,1}:\n 1.0\n 2.0\n 3.0\n 4.0\n\njulia> myappend([1.0,2.0,3.0],4)\nERROR: MethodError: no method matching myappend(::Array{Float64,1}, ::Int64)\nClosest candidates are:\n  myappend(::Array{T,1}, !Matched::T) where T at none:1As you can see, the type of the appended element must match the element type of the vector it is appended to, or else a MethodError is raised. In the following example, the method type parameter T is used as the return value:julia> mytypeof(x::T) where {T} = T\nmytypeof (generic function with 1 method)\n\njulia> mytypeof(1)\nInt64\n\njulia> mytypeof(1.0)\nFloat64Just as you can put subtype constraints on type parameters in type declarations (see Parametric Types), you can also constrain type parameters of methods:julia> same_type_numeric(x::T, y::T) where {T<:Number} = true\nsame_type_numeric (generic function with 1 method)\n\njulia> same_type_numeric(x::Number, y::Number) = false\nsame_type_numeric (generic function with 2 methods)\n\njulia> same_type_numeric(1, 2)\ntrue\n\njulia> same_type_numeric(1, 2.0)\nfalse\n\njulia> same_type_numeric(1.0, 2.0)\ntrue\n\njulia> same_type_numeric(\"foo\", 2.0)\nERROR: MethodError: no method matching same_type_numeric(::String, ::Float64)\nClosest candidates are:\n  same_type_numeric(!Matched::T<:Number, ::T<:Number) where T<:Number at none:1\n  same_type_numeric(!Matched::Number, ::Number) at none:1\n\njulia> same_type_numeric(\"foo\", \"bar\")\nERROR: MethodError: no method matching same_type_numeric(::String, ::String)\n\njulia> same_type_numeric(Int32(1), Int64(2))\nfalseThe same_type_numeric function behaves much like the same_type function defined above, but is only defined for pairs of numbers.Parametric methods allow the same syntax as where expressions used to write types (see UnionAll Types). If there is only a single parameter, the enclosing curly braces (in where {T}) can be omitted, but are often preferred for clarity. Multiple parameters can be separated with commas, e.g. where {T, S<:Real}, or written using nested where, e.g. where S<:Real where T."

    "text": "When redefining a method or adding new methods, it is important to realize that these changes don\'t take effect immediately. This is key to Julia\'s ability to statically infer and compile code to run fast, without the usual JIT tricks and overhead. Indeed, any new method definition won\'t be visible to the current runtime environment, including Tasks and Threads (and any previously defined @generated functions). Let\'s start with an example to see what this means:julia> function tryeval()\n           @eval newfun() = 1\n           newfun()\n       end\ntryeval (generic function with 1 method)\n\njulia> tryeval()\nERROR: MethodError: no method matching newfun()\nThe applicable method may be too new: running in world age xxxx1, while current world is xxxx2.\nClosest candidates are:\n  newfun() at none:1 (method too new to be called from this world context.)\n in tryeval() at none:1\n ...\n\njulia> newfun()\n1In this example, observe that the new definition for newfun has been created, but can\'t be immediately called. The new global is immediately visible to the tryeval function, so you could write return newfun (without parentheses). But neither you, nor any of your callers, nor the functions they call, or etc. can call this new method definition!But there\'s an exception: future calls to newfun from the REPL work as expected, being able to both see and call the new definition of newfun.However, future calls to tryeval will continue to see the definition of newfun as it was at the previous statement at the REPL, and thus before that call to tryeval.You may want to try this for yourself to see how it works.The implementation of this behavior is a \"world age counter\". This monotonically increasing value tracks each method definition operation. This allows describing \"the set of method definitions visible to a given runtime environment\" as a single number, or \"world age\". It also allows comparing the methods available in two worlds just by comparing their ordinal value. In the example above, we see that the \"current world\" (in which the method newfun exists), is one greater than the task-local \"runtime world\" that was fixed when the execution of tryeval started.Sometimes it is necessary to get around this (for example, if you are implementing the above REPL). Fortunately, there is an easy solution: call the function using Base.invokelatest:julia> function tryeval2()\n           @eval newfun2() = 2\n           Base.invokelatest(newfun2)\n       end\ntryeval2 (generic function with 1 method)\n\njulia> tryeval2()\n2Finally, let\'s take a look at some more complex examples where this rule comes into play. Define a function f(x), which initially has one method:julia> f(x) = \"original definition\"\nf (generic function with 1 method)Start some other operations that use f(x):julia> g(x) = f(x)\ng (generic function with 1 method)\n\njulia> t = @async f(wait()); yield();Now we add some new methods to f(x):julia> f(x::Int) = \"definition for Int\"\nf (generic function with 2 methods)\n\njulia> f(x::Type{Int}) = \"definition for Type{Int}\"\nf (generic function with 3 methods)Compare how these results differ:julia> f(1)\n\"definition for Int\"\n\njulia> g(1)\n\"definition for Int\"\n\njulia> fetch(schedule(t, 1))\n\"original definition\"\n\njulia> t = @async f(wait()); yield();\n\njulia> fetch(schedule(t, 1))\n\"definition for Int\""

    "text": "When building generic code, there is often a need for constructing a similar object with some change made to the layout of the type, also necessitating a change of the type parameters. For instance, you might have some sort of abstract array with an arbitrary element type and want to write your computation on it with a specific element type. We must implement a method for each AbstractArray{T} subtype that describes how to compute this type transform. There is no general transform of one subtype into another subtype with a different parameter. (Quick review: do you see why this is?)The subtypes of AbstractArray typically implement two methods to achieve this: A method to convert the input array to a subtype of a specific AbstractArray{T, N} abstract type; and a method to make a new uninitialized array with a specific element type. Sample implementations of these can be found in Julia Base. Here is a basic example usage of them, guaranteeing that input and output are of the same type:input = convert(AbstractArray{Eltype}, input)\noutput = similar(input, Eltype)As an extension of this, in cases where the algorithm needs a copy of the input array, convert is insufficient as the return value may alias the original input. Combining similar (to make the output array) and copyto! (to fill it with the input data) is a generic way to express the requirement for a mutable copy of the input argument:copy_with_eltype(input, Eltype) = copyto!(similar(input, Eltype), input)"

This may sound similar in approach to single-dispatch, but as we shall see below, it is still more flexible.For example, trying to dispatch on the element-type of an array will often run into ambiguous situations. Instead, commonly code will dispatch first on the container type, then recurse down to a more specific method based on eltype. In most cases, the algorithms lend themselves conveniently to this hierarchical approach, while in other cases, this rigor must be resolved manually. This dispatching branching can be observed, for example, in the logic to sum two matrices:# First dispatch selects the map algorithm for element-wise summation.\n+(a::Matrix, b::Matrix) = map(+, a, b)\n# Then dispatch handles each element and selects the appropriate\n# common element type for the computation.\n+(a, b) = +(promote(a, b)...)\n# Once the elements have the same type, they can be added.\n# For example, via primitive operations exposed by the processor.\n+(a::Float64, b::Float64) = Core.add(a, b)"

    "text": "A natural extension to the iterated dispatch above is to add a layer to method selection that allows to dispatch on sets of types which are independent from the sets defined by the type hierarchy. We could construct such a set by writing out a Union of the types in question, but then this set would not be extensible as Union-types cannot be altered after creation. However, such an extensible set can be programmed with a design pattern often referred to as a \"Holy-trait\".This pattern is implemented by defining a generic function which computes a different singleton value (or type) for each trait-set to which the function arguments may belong to.  If this function is pure there is no impact on performance compared to normal dispatch.The example in the previous section glossed over the implementation details of map and promote, which both operate in terms of these traits. When iterating over a matrix, such as in the implementation of map, one important question is what order to use to traverse the data. When AbstractArray subtypes implement the Base.IndexStyle trait, other functions such as map can dispatch on this information to pick the best algorithm (see Abstract Array Interface). This means that each subtype does not need to implement a custom version of map, since the generic definitions + trait classes will enable the system to select the fastest version. Here a toy implementation of map illustrating the trait-based dispatch:map(f, a::AbstractArray, b::AbstractArray) = map(Base.IndexStyle(a, b), f, a, b)\n# generic implementation:\nmap(::Base.IndexCartesian, f, a::AbstractArray, b::AbstractArray) = ...\n# linear-indexing implementation (faster)\nmap(::Base.IndexLinear, f, a::AbstractArray, b::AbstractArray) = ...This trait-based approach is also present in the promote mechanism employed by the scalar +. It uses promote_type, which returns the optimal common type to compute the operation given the two types of the operands. This makes it possible to reduce the problem of implementing every function for every pair of possible type arguments, to the much smaller problem of implementing a conversion operation from each type to a common type, plus a table of preferred pair-wise promotion rules."

In this case the result is 5, because f(1,2) invokes the first method of f above. However, this need not always be the case. If you define a fourth method that is more specialized for integers:f(a::Int,b::Int) = a-2bthen the result of both f() and f(1,2) is -3. In other words, optional arguments are tied to a function, not to any specific method of that function. It depends on the types of the optional arguments which method is invoked. When optional arguments are defined in terms of a global variable, the type of the optional argument may even change at run-time.Keyword arguments behave quite differently from ordinary positional arguments.

In Julia, type objects also serve as constructor functions: they create new instances of themselves when applied to an argument tuple as a function. This much was already mentioned briefly when composite types were introduced. For example:julia> struct Foo\n           bar\n           baz\n       end\n\njulia> foo = Foo(1, 2)\nFoo(1, 2)\n\njulia> foo.bar\n1\n\njulia> foo.baz\n2For many types, forming new objects by binding their field values together is all that is ever needed to create instances. There are, however, cases where more functionality is required when creating composite objects. Sometimes invariants must be enforced, either by checking arguments or by transforming them. Recursive data structures, especially those that may be self-referential, often cannot be constructed cleanly without first being created in an incomplete state and then altered programmatically to be made whole, as a separate step from object creation. Sometimes, it\'s just convenient to be able to construct objects with fewer or different types of parameters than they have fields. Julia\'s system for object construction addresses all of these cases and more.[1]: Nomenclature: while the term \"constructor\" generally refers to the entire function which constructs objects of a type, it is common to abuse terminology slightly and refer to specific constructor methods as \"constructors\". In such situations, it is generally clear from context that the term is used to mean \"constructor method\" rather than \"constructor function\", especially as it is often used in the sense of singling out a particular method of the constructor from all of the others."

This is simple:julia> Foo(x) = Foo(x,x)\nFoo\n\njulia> Foo(1)\nFoo(1, 1)You could also add a zero-argument Foo constructor method that supplies default values for both of the bar and baz fields:julia> Foo() = Foo(0)\nFoo\n\njulia> Foo()\nFoo(0, 0)Here the zero-argument constructor method calls the single-argument constructor method, which in turn calls the automatically provided two-argument constructor method.

Outer constructor methods can only ever create a new instance by calling another constructor method, such as the automatically provided default ones."

    "text": "While outer constructor methods succeed in addressing the problem of providing additional convenience methods for constructing objects, they fail to address the other two use cases mentioned in the introduction of this chapter: enforcing invariants, and allowing construction of self-referential objects. For these problems, one needs inner constructor methods. An inner constructor method is much like an outer constructor method, with two differences:It is declared inside the block of a type declaration, rather than outside of it like normal methods.\nIt has access to a special locally existent function called new that creates objects of the block\'s type.For example, suppose one wants to declare a type that holds a pair of real numbers, subject to the constraint that the first number is not greater than the second one. One could declare it like this:julia> struct OrderedPair\n           x::Real\n           y::Real\n           OrderedPair(x,y) = x > y ? error(\"out of order\") : new(x,y)\n       endNow OrderedPair objects can only be constructed such that x <= y:julia> OrderedPair(1, 2)\nOrderedPair(1, 2)\n\njulia> OrderedPair(2,1)\nERROR: out of order\nStacktrace:\n [1] error at ./error.jl:33 [inlined]\n [2] OrderedPair(::Int64, ::Int64) at ./none:4\n [3] top-level scopeIf the type were declared mutable, you could reach in and directly change the field values to violate this invariant, but messing around with an object\'s internals uninvited is considered poor form. You (or someone else) can also provide additional outer constructor methods at any later point, but once a type is declared, there is no way to add more inner constructor methods. Since outer constructor methods can only create objects by calling other constructor methods, ultimately, some inner constructor must be called to create an object. This guarantees that all objects of the declared type must come into existence by a call to one of the inner constructor methods provided with the type, thereby giving some degree of enforcement of a type\'s invariants.If any inner constructor method is defined, no default constructor method is provided: it is presumed that you have supplied yourself with all the inner constructors you need. The default constructor is equivalent to writing your own inner constructor method that takes all of the object\'s fields as parameters (constrained to be of the correct type, if the corresponding field has a type), and passes them to new, returning the resulting object:julia> struct Foo\n           bar\n           baz\n           Foo(bar,baz) = new(bar,baz)\n       end\nThis declaration has the same effect as the earlier definition of the Foo type without an explicit inner constructor method. The following two types are equivalent – one with a default constructor, the other with an explicit constructor:julia> struct T1\n           x::Int64\n       end\n\njulia> struct T2\n           x::Int64\n           T2(x) = new(x)\n       end\n\njulia> T1(1)\nT1(1)\n\njulia> T2(1)\nT2(1)\n\njulia> T1(1.0)\nT1(1)\n\njulia> T2(1.0)\nT2(1)It is considered good form to provide as few inner constructor methods as possible: only those taking all arguments explicitly and enforcing essential error checking and transformation. Additional convenience constructor methods, supplying default values or auxiliary transformations, should be provided as outer constructors that call the inner constructors to do the heavy lifting. This separation is typically quite natural."

    "category": "section",
    "text": "The final problem which has still not been addressed is construction of self-referential objects, or more generally, recursive data structures. Since the fundamental difficulty may not be immediately obvious, let us briefly explain it. Consider the following recursive type declaration:julia> mutable struct SelfReferential\n           obj::SelfReferential\n       end\nThis type may appear innocuous enough, until one considers how to construct an instance of it. If a is an instance of SelfReferential, then a second instance can be created by the call:julia> b = SelfReferential(a)But how does one construct the first instance when no instance exists to provide as a valid value for its obj field? The only solution is to allow creating an incompletely initialized instance of SelfReferential with an unassigned obj field, and using that incomplete instance as a valid value for the obj field of another instance, such as, for example, itself.To allow for the creation of incompletely initialized objects, Julia allows the new function to be called with fewer than the number of fields that the type has, returning an object with the unspecified fields uninitialized. The inner constructor method can then use the incomplete object, finishing its initialization before returning it. Here, for example, we take another crack at defining the SelfReferential type, with a zero-argument inner constructor returning instances having obj fields pointing to themselves:julia> mutable struct SelfReferential\n           obj::SelfReferential\n           SelfReferential() = (x = new(); x.obj = x)\n       end\nWe can verify that this constructor works and constructs objects that are, in fact, self-referential:julia> x = SelfReferential();\n\njulia> x === x\ntrue\n\njulia> x === x.obj\ntrue\n\njulia> x === x.obj.obj\ntrueAlthough it is generally a good idea to return a fully initialized object from an inner constructor, incompletely initialized objects can be returned:julia> mutable struct Incomplete\n           xx\n           Incomplete() = new()\n       end\n\njulia> z = Incomplete();While you are allowed to create objects with uninitialized fields, any access to an uninitialized reference is an immediate error:julia> z.xx\nERROR: UndefRefError: access to undefined referenceThis avoids the need to continually check for null values. However, not all object fields are references. Julia considers some types to be \"plain data\", meaning all of their data is self-contained and does not reference other objects. The plain data types consist of primitive types (e.g. Int) and immutable structs of other plain data types. The initial contents of a plain data type is undefined:julia> struct HasPlain\n           n::Int\n           HasPlain() = new()\n       end\n\njulia> HasPlain()\nHasPlain(438103441441)Arrays of plain data types exhibit the same behavior.You can pass incomplete objects to other functions from inner constructors to delegate their completion:julia> mutable struct Lazy\n           xx\n           Lazy(v) = complete_me(new(), v)\n       endAs with incomplete objects returned from constructors, if complete_me or any of its callees try to access the xx field of the Lazy object before it has been initialized, an error will be thrown immediately."

    "text": "Parametric types add a few wrinkles to the constructor story. Recall from Parametric Types that, by default, instances of parametric composite types can be constructed either with explicitly given type parameters or with type parameters implied by the types of the arguments given to the constructor. Here are some examples:julia> struct Point{T<:Real}\n           x::T\n           y::T\n       end\n\njulia> Point(1,2) ## implicit T ##\nPoint{Int64}(1, 2)\n\njulia> Point(1.0,2.5) ## implicit T ##\nPoint{Float64}(1.0, 2.5)\n\njulia> Point(1,2.5) ## implicit T ##\nERROR: MethodError: no method matching Point(::Int64, ::Float64)\nClosest candidates are:\n  Point(::T<:Real, ::T<:Real) where T<:Real at none:2\n\njulia> Point{Int64}(1, 2) ## explicit T ##\nPoint{Int64}(1, 2)\n\njulia> Point{Int64}(1.0,2.5) ## explicit T ##\nERROR: InexactError: Int64(Int64, 2.5)\nStacktrace:\n[...]\n\njulia> Point{Float64}(1.0, 2.5) ## explicit T ##\nPoint{Float64}(1.0, 2.5)\n\njulia> Point{Float64}(1,2) ## explicit T ##\nPoint{Float64}(1.0, 2.0)As you can see, for constructor calls with explicit type parameters, the arguments are converted to the implied field types: Point{Int64}(1,2) works, but Point{Int64}(1.0,2.5) raises an InexactError when converting 2.5 to Int64. When the type is implied by the arguments to the constructor call, as in Point(1,2), then the types of the arguments must agree – otherwise the T cannot be determined – but any pair of real arguments with matching type may be given to the generic Point constructor.What\'s really going on here is that Point, Point{Float64} and Point{Int64} are all different constructor functions. In fact, Point{T} is a distinct constructor function for each type T. Without any explicitly provided inner constructors, the declaration of the composite type Point{T<:Real} automatically provides an inner constructor, Point{T}, for each possible type T<:Real, that behaves just like non-parametric default inner constructors do. It also provides a single general outer Point constructor that takes pairs of real arguments, which must be of the same type. This automatic provision of constructors is equivalent to the following explicit declaration:julia> struct Point{T<:Real}\n           x::T\n           y::T\n           Point{T}(x,y) where {T<:Real} = new(x,y)\n       end\n\njulia> Point(x::T, y::T) where {T<:Real} = Point{T}(x,y);Notice that each definition looks like the form of constructor call that it handles. The call Point{Int64}(1,2) will invoke the definition Point{T}(x,y) inside the struct block. The outer constructor declaration, on the other hand, defines a method for the general Point constructor which only applies to pairs of values of the same real type. This declaration makes constructor calls without explicit type parameters, like Point(1,2) and Point(1.0,2.5), work. Since the method declaration restricts the arguments to being of the same type, calls like Point(1,2.5), with arguments of different types, result in \"no method\" errors.Suppose we wanted to make the constructor call Point(1,2.5) work by \"promoting\" the integer value 1 to the floating-point value 1.0. The simplest way to achieve this is to define the following additional outer constructor method:julia> Point(x::Int64, y::Float64) = Point(convert(Float64,x),y);This method uses the convert function to explicitly convert x to Float64 and then delegates construction to the general constructor for the case where both arguments are Float64. With this method definition what was previously a MethodError now successfully creates a point of type Point{Float64}:julia> Point(1,2.5)\nPoint{Float64}(1.0, 2.5)\n\njulia> typeof(ans)\nPoint{Float64}However, other similar calls still don\'t work:julia> Point(1.5,2)\nERROR: MethodError: no method matching Point(::Float64, ::Int64)\nClosest candidates are:\n  Point(::T<:Real, !Matched::T<:Real) where T<:Real at none:1For a more general way to make all such calls work sensibly, see Conversion and Promotion. At the risk of spoiling the suspense, we can reveal here that all it takes is the following outer method definition to make all calls to the general Point constructor work as one would expect:julia> Point(x::Real, y::Real) = Point(promote(x,y)...);The promote function converts all its arguments to a common type – in this case Float64. With this method definition, the Point constructor promotes its arguments the same way that numeric operators like + do, and works for all kinds of real numbers:julia> Point(1.5,2)\nPoint{Float64}(1.5, 2.0)\n\njulia> Point(1,1//2)\nPoint{Rational{Int64}}(1//1, 1//2)\n\njulia> Point(1.0,1//2)\nPoint{Float64}(1.0, 0.5)Thus, while the implicit type parameter constructors provided by default in Julia are fairly strict, it is possible to make them behave in a more relaxed but sensible manner quite easily. Moreover, since constructors can leverage all of the power of the type system, methods, and multiple dispatch, defining sophisticated behavior is typically quite simple."

The field declarations num::T and den::T indicate that the data held in a OurRational{T} object are a pair of integers of type T, one representing the rational value\'s numerator and the other representing its denominator.Now things get interesting. OurRational has a single inner constructor method which checks that both of num and den aren\'t zero and ensures that every rational is constructed in \"lowest terms\" with a non-negative denominator. This is accomplished by dividing the given numerator and denominator values by their greatest common divisor, computed using the gcd function. Since gcd returns the greatest common divisor of its arguments with sign matching the first argument (den here), after this division the new value of den is guaranteed to be non-negative. Because this is the only inner constructor for OurRational, we can be certain that OurRational objects are always constructed in this normalized form.OurRational also provides several outer constructor methods for convenience. The first is the \"standard\" general constructor that infers the type parameter T from the type of the numerator and denominator when they have the same type. The second applies when the given numerator and denominator values have different types: it promotes them to a common type and then delegates construction to the outer constructor for arguments of matching type. The third outer constructor turns integer values into rationals by supplying a value of 1 as the denominator.Following the outer constructor definitions, we defined a number of methods for the ⊘ operator, which provides a syntax for writing rationals (e.g. 1 ⊘ 2). Julia\'s Rational type uses the // operator for this purpose. Before these definitions, ⊘ is a completely undefined operator with only syntax and no meaning. Afterwards, it behaves just as described in Rational Numbers – its entire behavior is defined in these few lines. The first and most basic definition just makes a ⊘ b construct a OurRational by applying the OurRational constructor to a and b when they are integers. When one of the operands of ⊘ is already a rational number, we construct a new rational for the resulting ratio slightly differently; this behavior is actually identical to division of a rational with an integer. Finally, applying ⊘ to complex integral values creates an instance of Complex{OurRational} – a complex number whose real and imaginary parts are rationals:julia> z = (1 + 2im) ⊘ (1 - 2im);\n\njulia> typeof(z)\nComplex{OurRational{Int64}}\n\njulia> typeof(z) <: Complex{OurRational}\nfalseThus, although the ⊘ operator usually returns an instance of OurRational, if either of its arguments are complex integers, it will return an instance of Complex{OurRational} instead. The interested reader should consider perusing the rest of rational.jl: it is short, self-contained, and implements an entire basic Julia type."

However, in some cases one would rather not provide inner constructors, so that specific type parameters cannot be requested manually.For example, say we define a type that stores a vector along with an accurate representation of its sum:julia> struct SummedArray{T<:Number,S<:Number}\n           data::Vector{T}\n           sum::S\n       end\n\njulia> SummedArray(Int32[1; 2; 3], Int32(6))\nSummedArray{Int32,Int32}(Int32[1, 2, 3], 6)The problem is that we want S to be a larger type than T, so that we can sum many elements with less information loss. For example, when T is Int32, we would like S to be Int64. Therefore we want to avoid an interface that allows the user to construct instances of the type SummedArray{Int32,Int32}. One way to do this is to provide a constructor only for SummedArray, but inside the struct definition block to suppress generation of default constructors:julia> struct SummedArray{T<:Number,S<:Number}\n           data::Vector{T}\n           sum::S\n           function SummedArray(a::Vector{T}) where T\n               S = widen(T)\n               new{T,S}(a, sum(S, a))\n           end\n       end\n\njulia> SummedArray(Int32[1; 2; 3], Int32(6))\nERROR: MethodError: no method matching SummedArray(::Array{Int32,1}, ::Int32)\nClosest candidates are:\n  SummedArray(::Array{T,1}) where T at none:5This constructor will be invoked by the syntax SummedArray(a). The syntax new{T,S} allows specifying parameters for the type to be constructed, i.e. this call will return a SummedArray{T,S}. new{T,S} can be used in any constructor definition, but for convenience the parameters to new{} are automatically derived from the type being constructed when possible."

    "text": "Julia has a system for promoting arguments of mathematical operators to a common type, which has been mentioned in various other sections, including Integers and Floating-Point Numbers, Mathematical Operations and Elementary Functions, Types, and Methods. In this section, we explain how this promotion system works, as well as how to extend it to new types and apply it to functions besides built-in mathematical operators. Traditionally, programming languages fall into two camps with respect to promotion of arithmetic arguments:Automatic promotion for built-in arithmetic types and operators. In most languages, built-in numeric types, when used as operands to arithmetic operators with infix syntax, such as +, -, *, and /, are automatically promoted to a common type to produce the expected results. C, Java, Perl, and Python, to name a few, all correctly compute the sum 1 + 1.5 as the floating-point value 2.5, even though one of the operands to + is an integer. These systems are convenient and designed carefully enough that they are generally all-but-invisible to the programmer: hardly anyone consciously thinks of this promotion taking place when writing such an expression, but compilers and interpreters must perform conversion before addition since integers and floating-point values cannot be added as-is. Complex rules for such automatic conversions are thus inevitably part of specifications and implementations for such languages.\nNo automatic promotion. This camp includes Ada and ML – very \"strict\" statically typed languages. In these languages, every conversion must be explicitly specified by the programmer. Thus, the example expression 1 + 1.5 would be a compilation error in both Ada and ML. Instead one must write real(1) + 1.5, explicitly converting the integer 1 to a floating-point value before performing addition. Explicit conversion everywhere is so inconvenient, however, that even Ada has some degree of automatic conversion: integer literals are promoted to the expected integer type automatically, and floating-point literals are similarly promoted to appropriate floating-point types.In a sense, Julia falls into the \"no automatic promotion\" category: mathematical operators are just functions with special syntax, and the arguments of functions are never automatically converted. However, one may observe that applying mathematical operations to a wide variety of mixed argument types is just an extreme case of polymorphic multiple dispatch – something which Julia\'s dispatch and type systems are particularly well-suited to handle. \"Automatic\" promotion of mathematical operands simply emerges as a special application: Julia comes with pre-defined catch-all dispatch rules for mathematical operators, invoked when no specific implementation exists for some combination of operand types. These catch-all rules first promote all operands to a common type using user-definable promotion rules, and then invoke a specialized implementation of the operator in question for the resulting values, now of the same type. User-defined types can easily participate in this promotion system by defining methods for conversion to and from other types, and providing a handful of promotion rules defining what types they should promote to when mixed with other types."

    "text": "The standard way to obtain a value of a certain type T is to call the type\'s constructor, T(x). However, there are cases where it\'s convenient to convert a value from one type to another without the programmer asking for it explicitly. One example is assigning a value into an array: if A is a Vector{Float64}, the expression A[1] = 2 should work by automatically converting the 2 from Int to Float64, and storing the result in the array. This is done via the convert function.The convert function generally takes two arguments: the first is a type object and the second is a value to convert to that type. The returned value is the value converted to an instance of given type. The simplest way to understand this function is to see it in action:julia> x = 12\n12\n\njulia> typeof(x)\nInt64\n\njulia> convert(UInt8, x)\n0x0c\n\njulia> typeof(ans)\nUInt8\n\njulia> convert(AbstractFloat, x)\n12.0\n\njulia> typeof(ans)\nFloat64\n\njulia> a = Any[1 2 3; 4 5 6]\n2×3 Array{Any,2}:\n 1  2  3\n 4  5  6\n\njulia> convert(Array{Float64}, a)\n2×3 Array{Float64,2}:\n 1.0  2.0  3.0\n 4.0  5.0  6.0Conversion isn\'t always possible, in which case a no method error is thrown indicating that convert doesn\'t know how to perform the requested conversion:julia> convert(AbstractFloat, \"foo\")\nERROR: MethodError: Cannot `convert` an object of type String to an object of type AbstractFloat\n[...]Some languages consider parsing strings as numbers or formatting numbers as strings to be conversions (many dynamic languages will even perform conversion for you automatically), however Julia does not: even though some strings can be parsed as numbers, most strings are not valid representations of numbers, and only a very limited subset of them are. Therefore in Julia the dedicated parse function must be used to perform this operation, making it more explicit."

    "text": "When defining a new type, initially all ways of creating it should be defined as constructors. If it becomes clear that implicit conversion would be useful, and that some constructors meet the above \"safety\" criteria, then convert methods can be added. These methods are typically quite simple, as they only need to call the appropriate constructor. Such a definition might look like this:convert(::Type{MyType}, x) = MyType(x)The type of the first argument of this method is a singleton type, Type{MyType}, the only instance of which is MyType. Thus, this method is only invoked when the first argument is the type value MyType. Notice the syntax used for the first argument: the argument name is omitted prior to the :: symbol, and only the type is given. This is the syntax in Julia for a function argument whose type is specified but whose value does not need to be referenced by name. In this example, since the type is a singleton, we already know its value without referring to an argument name.All instances of some abstract types are by default considered \"sufficiently similar\" that a universal convert definition is provided in Julia Base. For example, this definition states that it\'s valid to convert any Number type to any other by calling a 1-argument constructor:convert(::Type{T}, x::Number) where {T<:Number} = T(x)This means that new Number types only need to define constructors, since this definition will handle convert for them. An identity conversion is also provided to handle the case where the argument is already of the requested type:convert(::Type{T}, x::T) where {T<:Number} = xSimilar definitions exist for AbstractString, AbstractArray, and AbstractDict."

    "title": "Promotion",
    "category": "section",
    "text": "Promotion refers to converting values of mixed types to a single common type. Although it is not strictly necessary, it is generally implied that the common type to which the values are converted can faithfully represent all of the original values. In this sense, the term \"promotion\" is appropriate since the values are converted to a \"greater\" type – i.e. one which can represent all of the input values in a single common type. It is important, however, not to confuse this with object-oriented (structural) super-typing, or Julia\'s notion of abstract super-types: promotion has nothing to do with the type hierarchy, and everything to do with converting between alternate representations. For instance, although every Int32 value can also be represented as a Float64 value, Int32 is not a subtype of Float64.Promotion to a common \"greater\" type is performed in Julia by the promote function, which takes any number of arguments, and returns a tuple of the same number of values, converted to a common type, or throws an exception if promotion is not possible. The most common use case for promotion is to convert numeric arguments to a common type:julia> promote(1, 2.5)\n(1.0, 2.5)\n\njulia> promote(1, 2.5, 3)\n(1.0, 2.5, 3.0)\n\njulia> promote(2, 3//4)\n(2//1, 3//4)\n\njulia> promote(1, 2.5, 3, 3//4)\n(1.0, 2.5, 3.0, 0.75)\n\njulia> promote(1.5, im)\n(1.5 + 0.0im, 0.0 + 1.0im)\n\njulia> promote(1 + 2im, 3//4)\n(1//1 + 2//1*im, 3//4 + 0//1*im)Floating-point values are promoted to the largest of the floating-point argument types. Integer values are promoted to the larger of either the native machine word size or the largest integer argument type. Mixtures of integers and floating-point values are promoted to a floating-point type big enough to hold all the values. Integers mixed with rationals are promoted to rationals. Rationals mixed with floats are promoted to floats. Complex values mixed with real values are promoted to the appropriate kind of complex value.That is really all there is to using promotions. The rest is just a matter of clever application, the most typical \"clever\" application being the definition of catch-all methods for numeric operations like the arithmetic operators +, -, * and /. Here are some of the catch-all method definitions given in promotion.jl:+(x::Number, y::Number) = +(promote(x,y)...)\n-(x::Number, y::Number) = -(promote(x,y)...)\n*(x::Number, y::Number) = *(promote(x,y)...)\n/(x::Number, y::Number) = /(promote(x,y)...)These method definitions say that in the absence of more specific rules for adding, subtracting, multiplying and dividing pairs of numeric values, promote the values to a common type and then try again. That\'s all there is to it: nowhere else does one ever need to worry about promotion to a common numeric type for arithmetic operations – it just happens automatically. There are definitions of catch-all promotion methods for a number of other arithmetic and mathematical functions in promotion.jl, but beyond that, there are hardly any calls to promote required in Julia Base. The most common usages of promote occur in outer constructors methods, provided for convenience, to allow constructor calls with mixed types to delegate to an inner type with fields promoted to an appropriate common type. For example, recall that rational.jl provides the following outer constructor method:Rational(n::Integer, d::Integer) = Rational(promote(n,d)...)This allows calls like the following to work:julia> Rational(Int8(15),Int32(-5))\n-3//1\n\njulia> typeof(ans)\nRational{Int32}For most user-defined types, it is better practice to require programmers to supply the expected types to constructor functions explicitly, but sometimes, especially for numeric problems, it can be convenient to do promotion automatically."

    "category": "section",
    "text": "Although one could, in principle, define methods for the promote function directly, this would require many redundant definitions for all possible permutations of argument types. Instead, the behavior of promote is defined in terms of an auxiliary function called promote_rule, which one can provide methods for. The promote_rule function takes a pair of type objects and returns another type object, such that instances of the argument types will be promoted to the returned type. Thus, by defining the rule:promote_rule(::Type{Float64}, ::Type{Float32}) = Float64one declares that when 64-bit and 32-bit floating-point values are promoted together, they should be promoted to 64-bit floating-point. The promotion type does not need to be one of the argument types, however; the following promotion rules both occur in Julia Base:promote_rule(::Type{UInt8}, ::Type{Int8}) = Int\npromote_rule(::Type{BigInt}, ::Type{Int8}) = BigIntIn the latter case, the result type is BigInt since BigInt is the only type large enough to hold integers for arbitrary-precision integer arithmetic. Also note that one does not need to define both promote_rule(::Type{A}, ::Type{B}) and promote_rule(::Type{B}, ::Type{A}) – the symmetry is implied by the way promote_rule is used in the promotion process.The promote_rule function is used as a building block to define a second function called promote_type, which, given any number of type objects, returns the common type to which those values, as arguments to promote should be promoted. Thus, if one wants to know, in absence of actual values, what type a collection of values of certain types would promote to, one can use promote_type:julia> promote_type(Int8, Int64)\nInt64Internally, promote_type is used inside of promote to determine what type argument values should be converted to for promotion. It can, however, be useful in its own right. The curious reader can read the code in promotion.jl, which defines the complete promotion mechanism in about 35 lines."

The second rule applies the same logic to two different types of rational numbers, resulting in a rational of the promotion of their respective numerator/denominator types. The third and final rule dictates that promoting a rational with a float results in the same type as promoting the numerator/denominator type with the float.This small handful of promotion rules, together with the type\'s constructors and the default convert method for numbers, are sufficient to make rational numbers interoperate completely naturally with all of Julia\'s other numeric types – integers, floating-point numbers, and complex numbers. By providing appropriate conversion methods and promotion rules in the same manner, any user-defined numeric type can interoperate just as naturally with Julia\'s predefined numerics."

Instead of mutating objects as they are iterated over, Julia iterators may keep track of the iteration state externally from the object. The return value from iterate is always either a tuple of a value and a state, or nothing if no elements remain. The state object will be passed back to the iterate function on the next iteration and is generally considered an implementation detail private to the iterable object.Any object that defines this function is iterable and can be used in the many functions that rely upon iteration. It can also be used directly in a for loop since the syntax:for i in iter   # or  \"for i = iter\"\n    # body\nendis translated into:next = iterate(iter)\nwhile next !== nothing\n    (i, state) = next\n    # body\n    next = iterate(iter, state)\nendA simple example is an iterable sequence of square numbers with a defined length:julia> struct Squares\n           count::Int\n       end\n\njulia> Base.iterate(S::Squares, state=1) = state > S.count ? nothing : (state*state, state+1)With only iterate definition, the Squares type is already pretty powerful.

We know that the elements in a Squares sequence will always be Int. By extending the eltype method, we can give that information to Julia and help it make more specialized code in the more complicated methods. We also know the number of elements in our sequence, so we can extend length, too:julia> Base.eltype(::Type{Squares}) = Int # Note that this is defined for the type\n\njulia> Base.length(S::Squares) = S.countNow, when we ask Julia to collect all the elements into an array it can preallocate a Vector{Int} of the right size instead of blindly push!ing each element into a Vector{Any}:julia> collect(Squares(4))\n4-element Array{Int64,1}:\n  1\n  4\n  9\n 16While we can rely upon generic implementations, we can also extend specific methods where we know there is a simpler algorithm. For example, there\'s a formula to compute the sum of squares, so we can override the generic iterative version with a more performant solution:julia> Base.sum(S::Squares) = (n = S.count; return n*(n+1)*(2n+1)÷6)\n\njulia> sum(Squares(1803))\n1955361914This is a very common pattern throughout Julia Base: a small set of required methods define an informal interface that enable many fancier behaviors. In some cases, types will want to additionally specialize those extra behaviors when they know a more efficient algorithm can be used in their specific case.It is also often useful to allow iteration over a collection in reverse order by iterating over Iterators.reverse(iterator).  To actually support reverse-order iteration, however, an iterator type T needs to implement iterate for Iterators.Reverse{T}. (Given r::Iterators.Reverse{T}, the underling iterator of type T is r.itr.) In our Squares example, we would implement Iterators.Reverse{Squares} methods:julia> Base.iterate(rS::Iterators.Reverse{Squares}, state=rS.itr.count) = state < 1 ? nothing : (state*state, state-1)\n\njulia> collect(Iterators.reverse(Squares(4)))\n4-element Array{Int64,1}:\n 16\n  9\n  4\n  1"

See the arrays manual page and the Julia Base section for more supported methods.A key part in defining an AbstractArray subtype is IndexStyle. Since indexing is such an important part of an array and often occurs in hot loops, it\'s important to make both indexing and indexed assignment as efficient as possible.  Array data structures are typically defined in one of two ways: either it most efficiently accesses its elements using just one index (linear indexing) or it intrinsically accesses the elements with indices specified for every dimension.  These two modalities are identified by Julia as IndexLinear() and IndexCartesian().  Converting a linear index to multiple indexing subscripts is typically very expensive, so this provides a traits-based mechanism to enable efficient generic code for all array types.This distinction determines which scalar indexing methods the type must define. IndexLinear() arrays are simple: just define getindex(A::ArrayType, i::Int).  When the array is subsequently indexed with a multidimensional set of indices, the fallback getindex(A::AbstractArray, I...)() efficiently converts the indices into one linear index and then calls the above method. IndexCartesian() arrays, on the other hand, require methods to be defined for each supported dimensionality with ndims(A) Int indices. For example, SparseMatrixCSC from the SparseArrays standard library module, only supports two dimensions, so it just defines getindex(A::SparseMatrixCSC, i::Int, j::Int). The same holds for setindex!.Returning to the sequence of squares from above, we could instead define it as a subtype of an AbstractArray{Int, 1}:julia> struct SquaresVector <: AbstractArray{Int, 1}\n           count::Int\n       end\n\njulia> Base.size(S::SquaresVector) = (S.count,)\n\njulia> Base.IndexStyle(::Type{<:SquaresVector}) = IndexLinear()\n\njulia> Base.getindex(S::SquaresVector, i::Int) = i*iNote that it\'s very important to specify the two parameters of the AbstractArray; the first defines the eltype, and the second defines the ndims. That supertype and those three methods are all it takes for SquaresVector to be an iterable, indexable, and completely functional array:julia> s = SquaresVector(4)\n4-element SquaresVector:\n  1\n  4\n  9\n 16\n\njulia> s[s .> 8]\n2-element Array{Int64,1}:\n  9\n 16\n\njulia> s + s\n4-element Array{Int64,1}:\n  2\n  8\n 18\n 32\n\njulia> sin.(s)\n4-element Array{Float64,1}:\n  0.8414709848078965\n -0.7568024953079282\n  0.4121184852417566\n -0.2879033166650653As a more complicated example, let\'s define our own toy N-dimensional sparse-like array type built on top of Dict:julia> struct SparseArray{T,N} <: AbstractArray{T,N}\n           data::Dict{NTuple{N,Int}, T}\n           dims::NTuple{N,Int}\n       end\n\njulia> SparseArray(::Type{T}, dims::Int...) where {T} = SparseArray(T, dims);\n\njulia> SparseArray(::Type{T}, dims::NTuple{N,Int}) where {T,N} = SparseArray{T,N}(Dict{NTuple{N,Int}, T}(), dims);\n\njulia> Base.size(A::SparseArray) = A.dims\n\njulia> Base.similar(A::SparseArray, ::Type{T}, dims::Dims) where {T} = SparseArray(T, dims)\n\njulia> Base.getindex(A::SparseArray{T,N}, I::Vararg{Int,N}) where {T,N} = get(A.data, I, zero(T))\n\njulia> Base.setindex!(A::SparseArray{T,N}, v, I::Vararg{Int,N}) where {T,N} = (A.data[I] = v)Notice that this is an IndexCartesian array, so we must manually define getindex and setindex! at the dimensionality of the array. Unlike the SquaresVector, we are able to define setindex!, and so we can mutate the array:julia> A = SparseArray(Float64, 3, 3)\n3×3 SparseArray{Float64,2}:\n 0.0  0.0  0.0\n 0.0  0.0  0.0\n 0.0  0.0  0.0\n\njulia> fill!(A, 2)\n3×3 SparseArray{Float64,2}:\n 2.0  2.0  2.0\n 2.0  2.0  2.0\n 2.0  2.0  2.0\n\njulia> A[:] = 1:length(A); A\n3×3 SparseArray{Float64,2}:\n 1.0  4.0  7.0\n 2.0  5.0  8.0\n 3.0  6.0  9.0The result of indexing an AbstractArray can itself be an array (for instance when indexing by an AbstractRange). The AbstractArray fallback methods use similar to allocate an Array of the appropriate size and element type, which is filled in using the basic indexing method described above. However, when implementing an array wrapper you often want the result to be wrapped as well:julia> A[1:2,:]\n2×3 SparseArray{Float64,2}:\n 1.0  4.0  7.0\n 2.0  5.0  8.0In this example it is accomplished by defining Base.similar{T}(A::SparseArray, ::Type{T}, dims::Dims) to create the appropriate wrapped array. (Note that while similar supports 1- and 2-argument forms, in most case you only need to specialize the 3-argument form.) For this to work it\'s important that SparseArray is mutable (supports setindex!). Defining similar, getindex and setindex! for SparseArray also makes it possible to copy the array:julia> copy(A)\n3×3 SparseArray{Float64,2}:\n 1.0  4.0  7.0\n 2.0  5.0  8.0\n 3.0  6.0  9.0In addition to all the iterable and indexable methods from above, these types can also interact with each other and use most of the methods defined in Julia Base for AbstractArrays:julia> A[SquaresVector(3)]\n3-element SparseArray{Float64,1}:\n 1.0\n 4.0\n 9.0\n\njulia> sum(A)\n45.0If you are defining an array type that allows non-traditional indexing (indices that start at something other than 1), you should specialize axes. You should also specialize similar so that the dims argument (ordinarily a Dims size-tuple) can accept AbstractUnitRange objects, perhaps range-types Ind of your own design.

This basic framework is extensible in three major ways:Ensuring that all arguments support broadcast\nSelecting an appropriate output array for the given set of arguments\nSelecting an efficient implementation for the given set of argumentsNot all types support axes and indexing, but many are convenient to allow in broadcast. The Base.broadcastable function is called on each argument to broadcast, allowing it to return something different that supports axes and indexing. By default, this is the identity function for all AbstractArrays and Numbers — they already support axes and indexing. For a handful of other types (including but not limited to types themselves, functions, special singletons like missing and nothing, and dates), Base.broadcastable returns the argument wrapped in a Ref to act as a 0-dimensional \"scalar\" for the purposes of broadcasting. Custom types can similarly specialize Base.broadcastable to define their shape, but they should follow the convention that collect(Base.broadcastable(x)) == collect(x). A notable exception is AbstractString; strings are special-cased to behave as scalars for the purposes of broadcast even though they are iterable collections of their characters (see Strings for more).The next two steps (selecting the output array and implementation) are dependent upon determining a single answer for a given set of arguments. Broadcast must take all the varied types of its arguments and collapse them down to just one output array and one implementation. Broadcast calls this single answer a \"style.\" Every broadcastable object each has its own preferred style, and a promotion-like system is used to combine these styles into a single answer — the \"destination style\"."

    "text": "In general, a broadcast operation is represented by a lazy Broadcasted container that holds onto the function to be applied alongside its arguments. Those arguments may themselves be more nested Broadcasted containers, forming a large expression tree to be evaluated. A nested tree of Broadcasted containers is directly constructed by the implicit dot syntax; 5 .+ 2.*x is transiently represented by Broadcasted(+, 5, Broadcasted(*, 2, x)), for example. This is invisible to users as it is immediately realized through a call to copy, but it is this container that provides the basis for broadcast\'s extensibility for authors of custom types. The built-in broadcast machinery will then determine the result type and size based upon the arguments, allocate it, and then finally copy the realization of the Broadcasted object into it with a default copyto!(::AbstractArray, ::Broadcasted) method. The built-in fallback broadcast and broadcast! methods similarly construct a transient Broadcasted representation of the operation so they can follow the same codepath. This allows custom array implementations to provide their own copyto! specialization to customize and optimize broadcasting. This is again determined by the computed broadcast style. This is such an important part of the operation that it is stored as the first type parameter of the Broadcasted type, allowing for dispatch and specialization.For some types, the machinery to \"fuse\" operations across nested levels of broadcasting is not available or could be done more efficiently incrementally. In such cases, you may need or want to evaluate x .* (x .+ 1) as if it had been written broadcast(*, x, broadcast(+, x, 1)), where the inner operation is evaluated before tackling the outer operation. This sort of eager operation is directly supported by a bit of indirection; instead of directly constructing Broadcasted objects, Julia lowers the fused expression x .* (x .+ 1) to Broadcast.broadcasted(*, x, Broadcast.broadcasted(+, x, 1)). Now, by default, broadcasted just calls the Broadcasted constructor to create the lazy representation of the fused expression tree, but you can choose to override it for a particular combination of function and arguments.As an example, the builtin AbstractRange objects use this machinery to optimize pieces of broadcasted expressions that can be eagerly evaluated purely in terms of the start, step, and length (or stop) instead of computing every single element. Just like all the other machinery, broadcasted also computes and exposes the combined broadcast style of its arguments, so instead of specializing on broadcasted(f, args...), you can specialize on broadcasted(::DestStyle, f, args...) for any combination of style, function, and arguments.For example, the following definition supports the negation of ranges:broadcasted(::DefaultArrayStyle{1}, ::typeof(-), r::OrdinalRange) = range(-first(r), step=-step(r), length=length(r))"

It is worth noting that you do not need to (and should not) define both argument orders of this call; defining one is sufficient no matter what order the user supplies the arguments in.For AbstractArray types, defining a BroadcastStyle supersedes the fallback choice, Broadcast.DefaultArrayStyle. DefaultArrayStyle and the abstract supertype, AbstractArrayStyle, store the dimensionality as a type parameter to support specialized array types that have fixed dimensionality requirements.DefaultArrayStyle \"loses\" to any other AbstractArrayStyle that has been defined because of the following methods:BroadcastStyle(a::AbstractArrayStyle{Any}, ::DefaultArrayStyle) = a\nBroadcastStyle(a::AbstractArrayStyle{N}, ::DefaultArrayStyle{N}) where N = a\nBroadcastStyle(a::AbstractArrayStyle{M}, ::DefaultArrayStyle{N}) where {M,N} =\n    typeof(a)(_max(Val(M),Val(N)))You do not need to write binary BroadcastStyle rules unless you want to establish precedence for two or more non-DefaultArrayStyle types.If your array type does have fixed dimensionality requirements, then you should subtype AbstractArrayStyle. For example, the sparse array code has the following definitions:struct SparseVecStyle <: Broadcast.AbstractArrayStyle{1} end\nstruct SparseMatStyle <: Broadcast.AbstractArrayStyle{2} end\nBase.BroadcastStyle(::Type{<:SparseVector}) = SparseVecStyle()\nBase.BroadcastStyle(::Type{<:SparseMatrixCSC}) = SparseMatStyle()Whenever you subtype AbstractArrayStyle, you also need to define rules for combining dimensionalities, by creating a constructor for your style that takes a Val(N) argument. For example:SparseVecStyle(::Val{0}) = SparseVecStyle()\nSparseVecStyle(::Val{1}) = SparseVecStyle()\nSparseVecStyle(::Val{2}) = SparseMatStyle()\nSparseVecStyle(::Val{N}) where N = Broadcast.DefaultArrayStyle{N}()These rules indicate that the combination of a SparseVecStyle with 0- or 1-dimensional arrays yields another SparseVecStyle, that its combination with a 2-dimensional array yields a SparseMatStyle, and anything of higher dimensionality falls back to the dense arbitrary-dimensional framework. These rules allow broadcasting to keep the sparse representation for operations that result in one or two dimensional outputs, but produce an Array for any other dimensionality."

Modules allow you to create top-level definitions (aka global variables) without worrying about name conflicts when your code is used together with somebody else\'s. Within a module, you can control which names from other modules are visible (via importing), and specify which of your names are intended to be public (via exporting).The following example demonstrates the major features of modules. It is not meant to be run, but is shown for illustrative purposes:module MyModule\nusing Lib\n\nusing BigLib: thing1, thing2\n\nimport Base.show\n\nexport MyType, foo\n\nstruct MyType\n    x\nend\n\nbar(x) = 2x\nfoo(a::MyType) = bar(a.x) + 1\n\nshow(io::IO, a::MyType) = print(io, \"MyType $(a.x)\")\nendNote that the style is not to indent the body of the module, since that would typically lead to whole files being indented.This module defines a type MyType, and two functions. Function foo and type MyType are exported, and so will be available for importing into other modules.  Function bar is private to MyModule.The statement using Lib means that a module called Lib will be available for resolving names as needed. When a global variable is encountered that has no definition in the current module, the system will search for it among variables exported by Lib and import it if it is found there. This means that all uses of that global within the current module will resolve to the definition of that variable in Lib.The statement using BigLib: thing1, thing2 brings just the identifiers thing1 and thing2 into scope from module BigLib. If these names refer to functions, adding methods to them will not be allowed (you may only \"use\" them, not extend them).The import keyword supports the same syntax as using, but only operates on a single name at a time. It does not add modules to be searched the way using does. import also differs from using in that functions imported using import can be extended with new methods.In MyModule above we wanted to add a method to the standard show function, so we had to write import Base.show. Functions whose names are only visible via using cannot be extended.Once a variable is made visible via using or import, a module may not create its own variable with the same name. Imported variables are read-only; assigning to a global variable always affects a variable owned by the current module, or else raises an error."

If the module does not exist, the system attempts to require(:Foo), which typically results in loading code from an installed package.However, some modules contain submodules, which means you sometimes need to access a non-top-level module. There are two ways to do this. The first is to use an absolute path, for example using Base.Sort. The second is to use a relative path, which makes it easier to import submodules of the current module or any of its enclosing modules:module Parent\n\nmodule Utils\n...\nend\n\nusing .Utils\n\n...\nendHere module Parent contains a submodule Utils, and code in Parent wants the contents of Utils to be visible. This is done by starting the using path with a period. Adding more leading periods moves up additional levels in the module hierarchy. For example using ..Utils would look for Utils in Parent\'s enclosing module rather than in Parent itself.Note that relative-import qualifiers are only valid in using and import statements."

It can also have methods added to it by using the qualified name as the function name. However, due to syntactic ambiguities that arise, if you wish to add methods to a function in a different module whose name contains only symbols, such as an operator, Base.+ for example, you must use Base.:+ to refer to it. If the operator is more than one character in length you must surround it in brackets, such as: Base.:(==).Macro names are written with @ in import and export statements, e.g. import Mod.@mac. Macros in other modules can be invoked as Mod.@mac or @Mod.mac.The syntax M.x = y does not work to assign a global in another module; global assignment is always module-local.A variable name can be \"reserved\" without assigning to it by declaring it as global x.

    "title": "Module initialization and precompilation",
    "category": "section",
    "text": "Large modules can take several seconds to load because executing all of the statements in a module often involves compiling a large amount of code. Julia creates precompiled caches of the module to reduce this time.The incremental precompiled module file are created and used automatically when using import or using to load a module.  This will cause it to be automatically compiled the first time it is imported. Alternatively, you can manually call Base.compilecache(modulename). The resulting cache files will be stored in DEPOT_PATH[1]/compiled/. Subsequently, the module is automatically recompiled upon using or import whenever any of its dependencies change; dependencies are modules it imports, the Julia build, files it includes, or explicit dependencies declared by include_dependency(path) in the module file(s).For file dependencies, a change is determined by examining whether the modification time (mtime) of each file loaded by include or added explicitly by include_dependency is unchanged, or equal to the modification time truncated to the nearest second (to accommodate systems that can\'t copy mtime with sub-second accuracy). It also takes into account whether the path to the file chosen by the search logic in require matches the path that had created the precompile file.It also takes into account the set of dependencies already loaded into the current process and won\'t recompile those modules, even if their files change or disappear, in order to avoid creating incompatibilities between the running system and the precompile cache. If you want to have changes to the source reflected in the running system, you should call reload(\"Module\") on the module you changed, and any module that depended on it in which you want to see the change reflected.If you know that a module is not safe to precompile your module (for example, for one of the reasons described below), you should put __precompile__(false) in the module file (typically placed at the top). This will cause Base.compilecache to throw an error, and will cause using / import to load it directly into the current process and skip the precompile and caching. This also thereby prevents the module from being imported by any other precompiled module.You may need to be aware of certain behaviors inherent in the creation of incremental shared libraries which may require care when writing your module. For example, external state is not preserved. To accommodate this, explicitly separate any initialization steps that must occur at runtime from steps that can occur at compile time. For this purpose, Julia allows you to define an __init__() function in your module that executes any initialization steps that must occur at runtime. This function will not be called during compilation (--output-*). Effectively, you can assume it will be run exactly once in the lifetime of the code. You may, of course, call it manually if necessary, but the default is to assume this function deals with computing state for the local machine, which does not need to be – or even should not be – captured in the compiled image. It will be called after the module is loaded into a process, including if it is being loaded into an incremental compile (--output-incremental=yes), but not if it is being loaded into a full-compilation process.In particular, if you define a function __init__() in a module, then Julia will call __init__() immediately after the module is loaded (e.g., by import, using, or require) at runtime for the first time (i.e., __init__ is only called once, and only after all statements in the module have been executed). Because it is called after the module is fully imported, any submodules or other imported modules have their __init__ functions called before the __init__ of the enclosing module.Two typical uses of __init__ are calling runtime initialization functions of external C libraries and initializing global constants that involve pointers returned by external libraries.  For example, suppose that we are calling a C library libfoo that requires us to call a foo_init() initialization function at runtime. Suppose that we also want to define a global constant foo_data_ptr that holds the return value of a void *foo_data() function defined by libfoo – this constant must be initialized at runtime (not at compile time) because the pointer address will change from run to run.  You could accomplish this by defining the following __init__ function in your module:const foo_data_ptr = Ref{Ptr{Cvoid}}(0)\nfunction __init__()\n    ccall((:foo_init, :libfoo), Cvoid, ())\n    foo_data_ptr[] = ccall((:foo_data, :libfoo), Ptr{Cvoid}, ())\n    nothing\nendNotice that it is perfectly possible to define a global inside a function like __init__; this is one of the advantages of using a dynamic language. But by making it a constant at global scope, we can ensure that the type is known to the compiler and allow it to generate better optimized code. Obviously, any other globals in your module that depends on foo_data_ptr would also have to be initialized in __init__.Constants involving most Julia objects that are not produced by ccall do not need to be placed in __init__: their definitions can be precompiled and loaded from the cached module image. This includes complicated heap-allocated objects like arrays. However, any routine that returns a raw pointer value must be called at runtime for precompilation to work (Ptr objects will turn into null pointers unless they are hidden inside an isbits object). This includes the return values of the Julia functions cfunction and pointer.Dictionary and set types, or in general anything that depends on the output of a hash(key) method, are a trickier case.  In the common case where the keys are numbers, strings, symbols, ranges, Expr, or compositions of these types (via arrays, tuples, sets, pairs, etc.) they are safe to precompile.  However, for a few other key types, such as Function or DataType and generic user-defined types where you haven\'t defined a hash method, the fallback hash method depends on the memory address of the object (via its objectid) and hence may change from run to run. If you have one of these key types, or if you aren\'t sure, to be safe you can initialize this dictionary from within your __init__ function. Alternatively, you can use the IdDict dictionary type, which is specially handled by precompilation so that it is safe to initialize at compile-time.When using precompilation, it is important to keep a clear sense of the distinction between the compilation phase and the execution phase. In this mode, it will often be much more clearly apparent that Julia is a compiler which allows execution of arbitrary Julia code, not a standalone interpreter that also generates compiled code.Other known potential failure scenarios include:Global counters (for example, for attempting to uniquely identify objects) Consider the following code snippet:\nmutable struct UniquedById\n    myid::Int\n    let counter = 0\n        UniquedById() = new(counter += 1)\n    end\nend\nwhile the intent of this code was to give every instance a unique id, the counter value is recorded at the end of compilation. All subsequent usages of this incrementally compiled module will start from that same counter value.\nNote that objectid (which works by hashing the memory pointer) has similar issues (see notes on Dict usage below).\nOne alternative is to use a macro to capture @__MODULE__ and store it alone with the current counter value, however, it may be better to redesign the code to not depend on this global state.\nAssociative collections (such as Dict and Set) need to be re-hashed in __init__. (In the future, a mechanism may be provided to register an initializer function.)\nDepending on compile-time side-effects persisting through load-time. Example include: modifying arrays or other variables in other Julia modules; maintaining handles to open files or devices; storing pointers to other system resources (including memory);\nCreating accidental \"copies\" of global state from another module, by referencing it directly instead of via its lookup path. For example, (in global scope):\n#mystdout = Base.stdout #= will not work correctly, since this will copy Base.stdout into this module =#\n# instead use accessor functions:\ngetstdout() = Base.stdout #= best option =#\n# or move the assignment into the runtime:\n__init__() = global mystdout = Base.stdout #= also works =#Several additional restrictions are placed on the operations that can be done while precompiling code to help the user avoid other wrong-behavior situations:Calling eval to cause a side-effect in another module. This will also cause a warning to be emitted when the incremental precompile flag is set.\nglobal const statements from local scope after __init__() has been started (see issue #12010 for plans to add an error for this)\nReplacing a module is a runtime error while doing an incremental precompile.A few other points to be aware of:No code reload / cache invalidation is performed after changes are made to the source files themselves, (including by [Pkg.update], and no cleanup is done after [Pkg.rm]\nThe memory sharing behavior of a reshaped array is disregarded by precompilation (each view gets its own copy)\nExpecting the filesystem to be unchanged between compile-time and runtime e.g. @__FILE__/source_path() to find resources at runtime, or the BinDeps @checked_lib macro. Sometimes this is unavoidable. However, when possible, it can be good practice to copy resources into the module at compile-time so they won\'t need to be found at runtime.\nWeakRef objects and finalizers are not currently handled properly by the serializer (this will be fixed in an upcoming release).\nIt is usually best to avoid capturing references to instances of internal metadata objects such as Method, MethodInstance, MethodTable, TypeMapLevel, TypeMapEntry and fields of those objects, as this can confuse the serializer and may not lead to the outcome you desire. It is not necessarily an error to do this, but you simply need to be prepared that the system will try to copy some of these and to create a single unique instance of others.It is sometimes helpful during module development to turn off incremental precompilation. The command line flag --compiled-modules={yes|no} enables you to toggle module precompilation on and off. When Julia is started with --compiled-modules=no the serialized modules in the compile cache are ignored when loading modules and module dependencies. Base.compilecache can still be called manually. The state of this command line flag is passed to Pkg.build to disable automatic precompilation triggering when installing, updating, and explicitly building packages."

    "text": "Julia enables package developers and users to document functions, types and other objects easily via a built-in documentation system since Julia 0.4.The basic syntax is simple: any string appearing at the top-level right before an object (function, macro, type or instance) will be interpreted as documenting it (these are called docstrings). Note that no blank lines or comments may intervene between a docstring and the documented object. Here is a basic example:\"Tell whether there are too foo items in the array.\"\nfoo(xs::Array) = ...Documentation is interpreted as Markdown, so you can use indentation and code fences to delimit code examples from text. Technically, any object can be associated with any other as metadata; Markdown happens to be the default, but one can construct other string macros and pass them to the @doc macro just as well.Here is a more complex example, still using Markdown:\"\"\"\n    bar(x[, y])\n\nCompute the Bar index between `x` and `y`. If `y` is missing, compute\nthe Bar index between all pairs of columns of `x`.\n\n# Examples\n```julia-repl\njulia> bar([1, 2], [1, 2])\n1\n```\n\"\"\"\nfunction bar(x, y) ...As in the example above, we recommend following some simple conventions when writing documentation:Always show the signature of a function at the top of the documentation, with a four-space indent so that it is printed as Julia code.\nThis can be identical to the signature present in the Julia code (like mean(x::AbstractArray)), or a simplified form. Optional arguments should be represented with their default values (i.e. f(x, y=1)) when possible, following the actual Julia syntax. Optional arguments which do not have a default value should be put in brackets (i.e. f(x[, y]) and f(x[, y[, z]])). An alternative solution is to use several lines: one without optional arguments, the other(s) with them. This solution can also be used to document several related methods of a given function. When a function accepts many keyword arguments, only include a <keyword arguments> placeholder in the signature (i.e. f(x; <keyword arguments>)), and give the complete list under an # Arguments section (see point 4 below).\nInclude a single one-line sentence describing what the function does or what the object represents after the simplified signature block. If needed, provide more details in a second paragraph, after a blank line.\nThe one-line sentence should use the imperative form (\"Do this\", \"Return that\") instead of the third person (do not write \"Returns the length...\") when documenting functions. It should end with a period. If the meaning of a function cannot be summarized easily, splitting it into separate composable parts could be beneficial (this should not be taken as an absolute requirement for every single case though).\nDo not repeat yourself.\nSince the function name is given by the signature, there is no need to start the documentation with \"The function bar...\": go straight to the point. Similarly, if the signature specifies the types of the arguments, mentioning them in the description is redundant.\nOnly provide an argument list when really necessary.\nFor simple functions, it is often clearer to mention the role of the arguments directly in the description of the function\'s purpose. An argument list would only repeat information already provided elsewhere. However, providing an argument list can be a good idea for complex functions with many arguments (in particular keyword arguments). In that case, insert it after the general description of the function, under an # Arguments header, with one - bullet for each argument. The list should mention the types and default values (if any) of the arguments:\n\"\"\"\n...\n# Arguments\n- `n::Integer`: the number of elements to compute.\n- `dim::Integer=1`: the dimensions along which to perform the computation.\n...\n\"\"\"\nProvide hints to related functions.\nSometimes there are functions of related functionality. To increase discoverability please provide a short list of these in a See also: paragraph.\nSee also: [`bar!`](@ref), [`baz`](@ref), [`baaz`](@ref)\nInclude any code examples in an # Examples section.\nExamples should, whenever possible, be written as doctests. A doctest is a fenced code block (see Code blocks) starting with ```jldoctest and contains any number of julia> prompts together with inputs and expected outputs that mimic the Julia REPL.\nFor example in the following docstring a variable a is defined and the expected result, as printed in a Julia REPL, appears afterwards:\n\"\"\"\nSome nice documentation here.\n\n# Examples\n```jldoctest\njulia> a = [1 2; 3 4]\n2×2 Array{Int64,2}:\n 1  2\n 3  4\n```\n\"\"\"\nwarning: Warning\nCalling rand and other RNG-related functions should be avoided in doctests since they will not produce consistent outputs during different Julia sessions. If you would like to show some random number generation related functionality, one option is to explicitly construct and seed your own MersenneTwister (or other pseudorandom number generator) and pass it to the functions you are doctesting.Operating system word size (Int32 or Int64) as well as path separator differences (/ or \\) will also affect the reproducibility of some doctests.Note that whitespace in your doctest is significant! The doctest will fail if you misalign the output of pretty-printing an array, for example.\nYou can then run make -C doc doctest=true to run all the doctests in the Julia Manual and API documentation, which will ensure that your example works.\nTo indicate that the output result is truncated, you may write [...] at the line where checking should stop. This is useful to hide a stacktrace (which contains non-permanent references to lines of julia code) when the doctest shows that an exception is thrown, for example:\n```jldoctest\njulia> div(1, 0)\nERROR: DivideError: integer division error\n[...]\n```\nExamples that are untestable should be written within fenced code blocks starting with ```julia so that they are highlighted correctly in the generated documentation.\ntip: Tip\nWherever possible examples should be self-contained and runnable so that readers are able to try them out without having to include any dependencies.\nUse backticks to identify code and equations.\nJulia identifiers and code excerpts should always appear between backticks ` to enable highlighting. Equations in the LaTeX syntax can be inserted between double backticks ``. Use Unicode characters rather than their LaTeX escape sequence, i.e. ``α = 1`` rather than ``\\\\alpha = 1``.\nPlace the starting and ending \"\"\" characters on lines by themselves.\nThat is, write:\n\"\"\"\n...\n\n...\n\"\"\"\nf(x, y) = ...\nrather than:\n\"\"\"...\n\n...\"\"\"\nf(x, y) = ...\nThis makes it more clear where docstrings start and end.\nRespect the line length limit used in the surrounding code.\nDocstrings are edited using the same tools as code. Therefore, the same conventions should apply. It it advised to add line breaks after 92 characters.\nProvide information allowing custom types to implement the function in an # Implementation section. These implementation details intended for developers rather than users, explaining e.g. which functions should be overridden and which functions automatically use appropriate fallbacks, are better kept separate from the main description of the function\'s behavior."

This allows sophisticated code generation without extra build steps, and also allows true Lisp-style macros operating at the level of abstract syntax trees. In contrast, preprocessor \"macro\" systems, like that of C and C++, perform textual manipulation and substitution before any actual parsing or interpretation occurs. Because all data types and code in Julia are represented by Julia data structures, powerful reflection capabilities are available to explore the internals of a program and its types just like any other data."

Thus, the value of a when the expression is evaluated no longer matters: the value in the expression is already 1, independent of whatever the value of a might be.\nOn the other hand, the symbol :b is used in the expression construction, so the value of the variable b at that time is irrelevant – :b is just a symbol and the variable b need not even be defined.

In this example, the compiler will replace all instances of @sayhello with::( println(\"Hello, world!\") )When @sayhello is entered in the REPL, the expression executes immediately, thus we only see the evaluation result:julia> @sayhello()\nHello, world!Now, consider a slightly more complex macro:julia> macro sayhello(name)\n           return :( println(\"Hello, \", $name) )\n       end\n@sayhello (macro with 1 method)This macro takes one argument: name. When @sayhello is encountered, the quoted expression is expanded to interpolate the value of the argument into the final expression:julia> @sayhello(\"human\")\nHello, humanWe can view the quoted return expression using the function macroexpand (important note: this is an extremely useful tool for debugging macros):julia> ex = macroexpand(Main, :(@sayhello(\"human\")) )\n:((Main.println)(\"Hello, \", \"human\"))\n\njulia> typeof(ex)\nExprWe can see that the \"human\" literal has been interpolated into the expression.There also exists a macro @macroexpand that is perhaps a bit more convenient than the macroexpand function:julia> @macroexpand @sayhello \"human\"\n:((println)(\"Hello, \", \"human\"))"

The two styles should not be mixed. For example, the following syntax is different from the examples above; it passes the tuple (expr1, expr2, ...) as one argument to the macro:@name (expr1, expr2, ...)An alternative way to invoke a macro over an array literal (or comprehension) is to juxtapose both without using parentheses. In this case, the array will be the only expression fed to the macro. The following syntax is equivalent (and different from @name [a b] * v):@name[a b] * v\n@name([a b]) * vIt is important to emphasize that macros receive their arguments as expressions, literals, or symbols. One way to explore macro arguments is to call the show function within the macro body:julia> macro showarg(x)\n           show(x)\n           # ... remainder of macro, returning an expression\n       end\n@showarg (macro with 1 method)\n\njulia> @showarg(a)\n:a\n\njulia> @showarg(1+1)\n:(1 + 1)\n\njulia> @showarg(println(\"Yo!\"))\n:(println(\"Yo!\"))In addition to the given argument list, every macro is passed extra arguments named __source__ and __module__.The argument __source__ provides information (in the form of a LineNumberNode object) about the parser location of the @ sign from the macro invocation. This allows macros to include better error diagnostic information, and is commonly used by logging, string-parser macros, and docs, for example, as well as to implement the @__LINE__, @__FILE__, and @__DIR__ macros.The location information can be accessed by referencing __source__.line and __source__.file:julia> macro __LOCATION__(); return QuoteNode(__source__); end\n@__LOCATION__ (macro with 1 method)\n\njulia> dump(\n            @__LOCATION__(\n       ))\nLineNumberNode\n  line: Int64 2\n  file: Symbol noneThe argument __module__ provides information (in the form of a Module object) about the expansion context of the macro invocation. This allows macros to look up contextual information, such as existing bindings, or to insert the value as an extra argument to a runtime function call doing self-reflection in the current module."

    "text": "Here is a simplified definition of Julia\'s @assert macro:julia> macro assert(ex)\n           return :( $ex ? nothing : throw(AssertionError($(string(ex)))) )\n       end\n@assert (macro with 1 method)This macro can be used like this:julia> @assert 1 == 1.0\n\njulia> @assert 1 == 0\nERROR: AssertionError: 1 == 0In place of the written syntax, the macro call is expanded at parse time to its returned result. This is equivalent to writing:1 == 1.0 ? nothing : throw(AssertionError(\"1 == 1.0\"))\n1 == 0 ? nothing : throw(AssertionError(\"1 == 0\"))That is, in the first call, the expression :(1 == 1.0) is spliced into the test condition slot, while the value of string(:(1 == 1.0)) is spliced into the assertion message slot. The entire expression, thus constructed, is placed into the syntax tree where the @assert macro call occurs. Then at execution time, if the test expression evaluates to true, then nothing is returned, whereas if the test is false, an error is raised indicating the asserted expression that was false. Notice that it would not be possible to write this as a function, since only the value of the condition is available and it would be impossible to display the expression that computed it in the error message.The actual definition of @assert in Julia Base is more complicated. It allows the user to optionally specify their own error message, instead of just printing the failed expression. Just like in functions with a variable number of arguments, this is specified with an ellipses following the last argument:julia> macro assert(ex, msgs...)\n           msg_body = isempty(msgs) ? ex : msgs[1]\n           msg = string(msg_body)\n           return :($ex ? nothing : throw(AssertionError($msg)))\n       end\n@assert (macro with 1 method)Now @assert has two modes of operation, depending upon the number of arguments it receives! If there\'s only one argument, the tuple of expressions captured by msgs will be empty and it will behave the same as the simpler definition above. But now if the user specifies a second argument, it is printed in the message body instead of the failing expression. You can inspect the result of a macro expansion with the aptly named @macroexpand macro:julia> @macroexpand @assert a == b\n:(if Main.a == Main.b\n        Main.nothing\n    else\n        (Main.throw)((Main.AssertionError)(\"a == b\"))\n    end)\n\njulia> @macroexpand @assert a==b \"a should equal b!\"\n:(if Main.a == Main.b\n        Main.nothing\n    else\n        (Main.throw)((Main.AssertionError)(\"a should equal b!\"))\n    end)There is yet another case that the actual @assert macro handles: what if, in addition to printing \"a should equal b,\" we wanted to print their values? One might naively try to use string interpolation in the custom message, e.g., @assert a==b \"a ($a) should equal b ($b)!\", but this won\'t work as expected with the above macro. Can you see why? Recall from string interpolation that an interpolated string is rewritten to a call to string. Compare:julia> typeof(:(\"a should equal b\"))\nString\n\njulia> typeof(:(\"a ($a) should equal b ($b)!\"))\nExpr\n\njulia> dump(:(\"a ($a) should equal b ($b)!\"))\nExpr\n  head: Symbol string\n  args: Array{Any}((5,))\n    1: String \"a (\"\n    2: Symbol a\n    3: String \") should equal b (\"\n    4: Symbol b\n    5: String \")!\"So now instead of getting a plain string in msg_body, the macro is receiving a full expression that will need to be evaluated in order to display as expected. This can be spliced directly into the returned expression as an argument to the string call; see error.jl for the complete implementation.The @assert macro makes great use of splicing into quoted expressions to simplify the manipulation of expressions inside the macro body."

    "page": "Metaprogramming",
    "title": "Hygiene",
    "category": "section",
    "text": "An issue that arises in more complex macros is that of hygiene. In short, macros must ensure that the variables they introduce in their returned expressions do not accidentally clash with existing variables in the surrounding code they expand into. Conversely, the expressions that are passed into a macro as arguments are often expected to evaluate in the context of the surrounding code, interacting with and modifying the existing variables. Another concern arises from the fact that a macro may be called in a different module from where it was defined. In this case we need to ensure that all global variables are resolved to the correct module. Julia already has a major advantage over languages with textual macro expansion (like C) in that it only needs to consider the returned expression. All the other variables (such as msg in @assert above) follow the normal scoping block behavior.To demonstrate these issues, let us consider writing a @time macro that takes an expression as its argument, records the time, evaluates the expression, records the time again, prints the difference between the before and after times, and then has the value of the expression as its final value. The macro might look like this:macro time(ex)\n    return quote\n        local t0 = time()\n        local val = $ex\n        local t1 = time()\n        println(\"elapsed time: \", t1-t0, \" seconds\")\n        val\n    end\nendHere, we want t0, t1, and val to be private temporary variables, and we want time to refer to the time function in Julia Base, not to any time variable the user might have (the same applies to println). Imagine the problems that could occur if the user expression ex also contained assignments to a variable called t0, or defined its own time variable. We might get errors, or mysteriously incorrect behavior.Julia\'s macro expander solves these problems in the following way. First, variables within a macro result are classified as either local or global. A variable is considered local if it is assigned to (and not declared global), declared local, or used as a function argument name. Otherwise, it is considered global. Local variables are then renamed to be unique (using the gensym function, which generates new symbols), and global variables are resolved within the macro definition environment. Therefore both of the above concerns are handled; the macro\'s locals will not conflict with any user variables, and time and println will refer to the Julia Base definitions.One problem remains however. Consider the following use of this macro:module MyModule\nimport Base.@time\n\ntime() = ... # compute something\n\n@time time()\nendHere the user expression ex is a call to time, but not the same time function that the macro uses. It clearly refers to MyModule.time. Therefore we must arrange for the code in ex to be resolved in the macro call environment. This is done by \"escaping\" the expression with esc:macro time(ex)\n    ...\n    local val = $(esc(ex))\n    ...\nendAn expression wrapped in this manner is left alone by the macro expander and simply pasted into the output verbatim. Therefore it will be resolved in the macro call environment.This escaping mechanism can be used to \"violate\" hygiene when necessary, in order to introduce or manipulate user variables. For example, the following macro sets x to zero in the call environment:julia> macro zerox()\n           return esc(:(x = 0))\n       end\n@zerox (macro with 1 method)\n\njulia> function foo()\n           x = 1\n           @zerox\n           return x # is zero\n       end\nfoo (generic function with 1 method)\n\njulia> foo()\n0This kind of manipulation of variables should be used judiciously, but is occasionally quite handy.Getting the hygiene rules correct can be a formidable challenge. Before using a macro, you might want to consider whether a function closure would be sufficient. Another useful strategy is to defer as much work as possible to runtime. For example, many macros simply wrap their arguments in a QuoteNode or other similar Expr. Some examples of this include @task body which simply returns schedule(Task(() -> $body)), and @eval expr, which simply returns eval(QuoteNode(expr)).To demonstrate, we might rewrite the @time example above as:macro time(expr)\n    return :(timeit(() -> $(esc(expr))))\nend\nfunction timeit(f)\n    t0 = time()\n    val = f()\n    t1 = time()\n    println(\"elapsed time: \", t1-t0, \" seconds\")\n    return val\nendHowever, we don\'t do this for a good reason: wrapping the expr in a new scope block (the anonymous function) also slightly changes the meaning of the expression (the scope of any variables in it), while we want @time to be usable with minimum impact on the wrapped code."

In most languages, this requires an extra build step, and a separate program to generate the repetitive code.

For example, consider the following custom typestruct MyNumber\n    x::Float64\nend\n# output\nfor which we want to add a number of methods to. We can do this programmatically in the following loop:for op = (:sin, :cos, :tan, :log, :exp)\n    eval(quote\n        Base.$op(a::MyNumber) = MyNumber($op(a.x))\n    end)\nend\n# output\nand we can now use those functions with our custom type:julia> x = MyNumber(π)\nMyNumber(3.141592653589793)\n\njulia> sin(x)\nMyNumber(1.2246467991473532e-16)\n\njulia> cos(x)\nMyNumber(-1.0)In this manner, Julia acts as its own preprocessor, and allows code generation from inside the language.

For example:r\"^\\s*(?:#|$)\" produces a regular expression object rather than a string\nb\"DATA\\xff\\u2200\" is a byte array literal for [68,65,84,65,255,226,136,128].Perhaps surprisingly, these behaviors are not hard-coded into the Julia parser or compiler. Instead, they are custom behaviors provided by a general mechanism that anyone can use: prefixed string literals are parsed as calls to specially-named macros. For example, the regular expression macro is just the following:macro r_str(p)\n    Regex(p)\nendThat\'s all. This macro says that the literal contents of the string literal r\"^\\s*(?:#|$)\" should be passed to the @r_str macro and the result of that expansion should be placed in the syntax tree where the string literal occurs. In other words, the expression r\"^\\s*(?:#|$)\" is equivalent to placing the following object directly into the syntax tree:Regex(\"^\\\\s*(?:#|\\$)\")Not only is the string literal form shorter and far more convenient, but it is also more efficient: since the regular expression is compiled and the Regex object is actually created when the code is compiled, the compilation occurs only once, rather than every time the code is executed. Consider if the regular expression occurs in a loop:for line = lines\n    m = match(r\"^\\s*(?:#|$)\", line)\n    if m === nothing\n        # non-comment\n    else\n        # comment\n    end\nendSince the regular expression r\"^\\s*(?:#|$)\" is compiled and inserted into the syntax tree when this code is parsed, the expression is only compiled once instead of each time the loop is executed. In order to accomplish this without macros, one would have to write this loop like this:re = Regex(\"^\\\\s*(?:#|\\$)\")\nfor line = lines\n    m = match(re, line)\n    if m === nothing\n        # non-comment\n    else\n        # comment\n    end\nendMoreover, if the compiler could not determine that the regex object was constant over all loops, certain optimizations might not be possible, making this version still less efficient than the more convenient literal form above. Of course, there are still situations where the non-literal form is more convenient: if one needs to interpolate a variable into the regular expression, one must take this more verbose approach; in cases where the regular expression pattern itself is dynamic, potentially changing upon each loop iteration, a new regular expression object must be constructed on each iteration. In the vast majority of use cases, however, regular expressions are not constructed based on run-time data. In this majority of cases, the ability to write regular expressions as compile-time values is invaluable.Like non-standard string literals, non-standard command literals exist using a prefixed variant of the command literal syntax. The command literal custom`literal` is parsed as @custom_cmd \"literal\". Julia itself does not contain any non-standard command literals, but packages can make use of this syntax. Aside from the different syntax and the _cmd suffix instead of the _str suffix, non-standard command literals behave exactly like non-standard string literals.In the event that two modules provide non-standard string or command literals with the same name, it is possible to qualify the string or command literal with a module name. For instance, if both Foo and Bar provide non-standard string literal @x_str, then one can write Foo.x\"literal\" or Bar.x\"literal\" to disambiguate between the two.The mechanism for user-defined string literals is deeply, profoundly powerful. Not only are Julia\'s non-standard literals implemented using it, but also the command literal syntax (`echo \"Hello, $person\"`) is implemented with the following innocuous-looking macro:macro cmd(str)\n    :(cmd_gen($(shell_parse(str)[1])))\nendOf course, a large amount of complexity is hidden in the functions used in this macro definition, but they are just functions, written entirely in Julia. You can read their source and see precisely what they do – and all they do is construct expression objects to be inserted into your program\'s syntax tree."

    "location": "manual/metaprogramming/#Generated-functions-1",
    "page": "Metaprogramming",
    "title": "Generated functions",
    "category": "section",
    "text": "A very special macro is @generated, which allows you to define so-called generated functions. These have the capability to generate specialized code depending on the types of their arguments with more flexibility and/or less code than what can be achieved with multiple dispatch. While macros work with expressions at parse time and cannot access the types of their inputs, a generated function gets expanded at a time when the types of the arguments are known, but the function is not yet compiled.Instead of performing some calculation or action, a generated function declaration returns a quoted expression which then forms the body for the method corresponding to the types of the arguments. When a generated function is called, the expression it returns is compiled and then run. To make this efficient, the result is usually cached. And to make this inferable, only a limited subset of the language is usable. Thus, generated functions provide a flexible way to move work from run time to compile time, at the expense of greater restrictions on allowed constructs.When defining generated functions, there are four main differences to ordinary functions:You annotate the function declaration with the @generated macro. This adds some information to the AST that lets the compiler know that this is a generated function.\nIn the body of the generated function you only have access to the types of the arguments – not their values – and any function that was defined before the definition of the generated function.\nInstead of calculating something or performing some action, you return a quoted expression which, when evaluated, does what you want.\nGenerated functions must not mutate or observe any non-constant global state (including, for example, IO, locks, non-local dictionaries, or using hasmethod). This means they can only read global constants, and cannot have any side effects. In other words, they must be completely pure. Due to an implementation limitation, this also means that they currently cannot define a closure or generator.It\'s easiest to illustrate this with an example. We can declare a generated function foo asjulia> @generated function foo(x)\n           Core.println(x)\n           return :(x * x)\n       end\nfoo (generic function with 1 method)Note that the body returns a quoted expression, namely :(x * x), rather than just the value of x * x.From the caller\'s perspective, this is identical to a regular function; in fact, you don\'t have to know whether you\'re calling a regular or generated function. Let\'s see how foo behaves:julia> x = foo(2); # note: output is from println() statement in the body\nInt64\n\njulia> x           # now we print x\n4\n\njulia> y = foo(\"bar\");\nString\n\njulia> y\n\"barbar\"So, we see that in the body of the generated function, x is the type of the passed argument, and the value returned by the generated function, is the result of evaluating the quoted expression we returned from the definition, now with the value of x.What happens if we evaluate foo again with a type that we have already used?julia> foo(4)\n16Note that there is no printout of Int64. We can see that the body of the generated function was only executed once here, for the specific set of argument types, and the result was cached. After that, for this example, the expression returned from the generated function on the first invocation was re-used as the method body. However, the actual caching behavior is an implementation-defined performance optimization, so it is invalid to depend too closely on this behavior.The number of times a generated function is generated might be only once, but it might also be more often, or appear to not happen at all. As a consequence, you should never write a generated function with side effects - when, and how often, the side effects occur is undefined. (This is true for macros too - and just like for macros, the use of eval in a generated function is a sign that you\'re doing something the wrong way.) However, unlike macros, the runtime system cannot correctly handle a call to eval, so it is disallowed.It is also important to see how @generated functions interact with method redefinition. Following the principle that a correct @generated function must not observe any mutable state or cause any mutation of global state, we see the following behavior. Observe that the generated function cannot call any method that was not defined prior to the definition of the generated function itself.Initially f(x) has one definitionjulia> f(x) = \"original definition\";Define other operations that use f(x):julia> g(x) = f(x);\n\njulia> @generated gen1(x) = f(x);\n\njulia> @generated gen2(x) = :(f(x));We now add some new definitions for f(x):julia> f(x::Int) = \"definition for Int\";\n\njulia> f(x::Type{Int}) = \"definition for Type{Int}\";and compare how these results differ:julia> f(1)\n\"definition for Int\"\n\njulia> g(1)\n\"definition for Int\"\n\njulia> gen1(1)\n\"original definition\"\n\njulia> gen2(1)\n\"definition for Int\"Each method of a generated function has its own view of defined functions:julia> @generated gen1(x::Real) = f(x);\n\njulia> gen1(1)\n\"definition for Type{Int}\"The example generated function foo above did not do anything a normal function foo(x) = x * x could not do (except printing the type on the first invocation, and incurring higher overhead). However, the power of a generated function lies in its ability to compute different quoted expressions depending on the types passed to it:julia> @generated function bar(x)\n           if x <: Integer\n               return :(x ^ 2)\n           else\n               return :(x)\n           end\n       end\nbar (generic function with 1 method)\n\njulia> bar(4)\n16\n\njulia> bar(\"baz\")\n\"baz\"(although of course this contrived example would be more easily implemented using multiple dispatch...)Abusing this will corrupt the runtime system and cause undefined behavior:julia> @generated function baz(x)\n           if rand() < .9\n               return :(x^2)\n           else\n               return :(\"boo!\")\n           end\n       end\nbaz (generic function with 1 method)Since the body of the generated function is non-deterministic, its behavior, and the behavior of all subsequent code is undefined.Don\'t copy these examples!These examples are hopefully helpful to illustrate how generated functions work, both in the definition end and at the call site; however, don\'t copy them, for the following reasons:the foo function has side-effects (the call to Core.println), and it is undefined exactly when, how often or how many times these side-effects will occur\nthe bar function solves a problem that is better solved with multiple dispatch - defining bar(x) = x and bar(x::Integer) = x ^ 2 will do the same thing, but it is both simpler and faster.\nthe baz function is pathologicalNote that the set of operations that should not be attempted in a generated function is unbounded, and the runtime system can currently only detect a subset of the invalid operations. There are many other operations that will simply corrupt the runtime system without notification, usually in subtle ways not obviously connected to the bad definition. Because the function generator is run during inference, it must respect all of the limitations of that code.Some operations that should not be attempted include:Caching of native pointers.\nInteracting with the contents or methods of Core.Compiler in any way.\nObserving any mutable state.\nInference on the generated function may be run at any time, including while your code is attempting to observe or mutate this state.\nTaking any locks: C code you call out to may use locks internally, (for example, it is not problematic to call malloc, even though most implementations require locks internally) but don\'t attempt to hold or acquire any while executing Julia code.\nCalling any function that is defined after the body of the generated function. This condition is relaxed for incrementally-loaded precompiled modules to allow calling any function in the module.Alright, now that we have a better understanding of how generated functions work, let\'s use them to build some more advanced (and valid) functionality..."

    "text": "Julia\'s base library has a an internal sub2ind function to calculate a linear index into an n-dimensional array, based on a set of n multilinear indices - in other words, to calculate the index i that can be used to index into an array A using A[i], instead of A[x,y,z,...]. One possible implementation is the following:julia> function sub2ind_loop(dims::NTuple{N}, I::Integer...) where N\n           ind = I[N] - 1\n           for i = N-1:-1:1\n               ind = I[i]-1 + dims[i]*ind\n           end\n           return ind + 1\n       end\nsub2ind_loop (generic function with 1 method)\n\njulia> sub2ind_loop((3, 5), 1, 2)\n4The same thing can be done using recursion:julia> sub2ind_rec(dims::Tuple{}) = 1;\n\njulia> sub2ind_rec(dims::Tuple{}, i1::Integer, I::Integer...) =\n           i1 == 1 ? sub2ind_rec(dims, I...) : throw(BoundsError());\n\njulia> sub2ind_rec(dims::Tuple{Integer, Vararg{Integer}}, i1::Integer) = i1;\n\njulia> sub2ind_rec(dims::Tuple{Integer, Vararg{Integer}}, i1::Integer, I::Integer...) =\n           i1 + dims[1] * (sub2ind_rec(Base.tail(dims), I...) - 1);\n\njulia> sub2ind_rec((3, 5), 1, 2)\n4Both these implementations, although different, do essentially the same thing: a runtime loop over the dimensions of the array, collecting the offset in each dimension into the final index.However, all the information we need for the loop is embedded in the type information of the arguments. Thus, we can utilize generated functions to move the iteration to compile-time; in compiler parlance, we use generated functions to manually unroll the loop. The body becomes almost identical, but instead of calculating the linear index, we build up an expression that calculates the index:julia> @generated function sub2ind_gen(dims::NTuple{N}, I::Integer...) where N\n           ex = :(I[$N] - 1)\n           for i = (N - 1):-1:1\n               ex = :(I[$i] - 1 + dims[$i] * $ex)\n           end\n           return :($ex + 1)\n       end\nsub2ind_gen (generic function with 1 method)\n\njulia> sub2ind_gen((3, 5), 1, 2)\n4What code will this generate?An easy way to find out is to extract the body into another (regular) function:julia> @generated function sub2ind_gen(dims::NTuple{N}, I::Integer...) where N\n           return sub2ind_gen_impl(dims, I...)\n       end\nsub2ind_gen (generic function with 1 method)\n\njulia> function sub2ind_gen_impl(dims::Type{T}, I...) where T <: NTuple{N,Any} where N\n           length(I) == N || return :(error(\"partial indexing is unsupported\"))\n           ex = :(I[$N] - 1)\n           for i = (N - 1):-1:1\n               ex = :(I[$i] - 1 + dims[$i] * $ex)\n           end\n           return :($ex + 1)\n       end\nsub2ind_gen_impl (generic function with 1 method)We can now execute sub2ind_gen_impl and examine the expression it returns:julia> sub2ind_gen_impl(Tuple{Int,Int}, Int, Int)\n:(((I[1] - 1) + dims[1] * (I[2] - 1)) + 1)So, the method body that will be used here doesn\'t include a loop at all - just indexing into the two tuples, multiplication and addition/subtraction. All the looping is performed compile-time, and we avoid looping during execution entirely. Thus, we only loop once per type, in this case once per N (except in edge cases where the function is generated more than once - see disclaimer above)."

    "category": "section",
    "text": "Generated functions can achieve high efficiency at run time, but come with a compile time cost: a new function body must be generated for every combination of concrete argument types. Typically, Julia is able to compile \"generic\" versions of functions that will work for any arguments, but with generated functions this is impossible. This means that programs making heavy use of generated functions might be impossible to statically compile.To solve this problem, the language provides syntax for writing normal, non-generated alternative implementations of generated functions. Applied to the sub2ind example above, it would look like this:function sub2ind_gen(dims::NTuple{N}, I::Integer...) where N\n    if N != length(I)\n        throw(ArgumentError(\"Number of dimensions must match number of indices.\"))\n    end\n    if @generated\n        ex = :(I[$N] - 1)\n        for i = (N - 1):-1:1\n            ex = :(I[$i] - 1 + dims[$i] * $ex)\n        end\n        return :($ex + 1)\n    else\n        ind = I[N] - 1\n        for i = (N - 1):-1:1\n            ind = I[i] - 1 + dims[i]*ind\n        end\n        return ind + 1\n    end\nendInternally, this code creates two implementations of the function: a generated one where the first block in if @generated is used, and a normal one where the else block is used. Inside the then part of the if @generated block, code has the same semantics as other generated functions: argument names refer to types, and the code should return an expression. Multiple if @generated blocks may occur, in which case the generated implementation uses all of the then blocks and the alternate implementation uses all of the else blocks.Notice that we added an error check to the top of the function. This code will be common to both versions, and is run-time code in both versions (it will be quoted and returned as an expression from the generated version). That means that the values and types of local variables are not available at code generation time –- the code-generation code can only see the types of arguments.In this style of definition, the code generation feature is essentially an optional optimization. The compiler will use it if convenient, but otherwise may choose to use the normal implementation instead. This style is preferred, since it allows the compiler to make more decisions and compile programs in more ways, and since normal code is more readable than code-generating code. However, which implementation is used depends on compiler implementation details, so it is essential for the two implementations to behave identically."

    "text": "Julia, like most technical computing languages, provides a first-class array implementation. Most technical computing languages pay a lot of attention to their array implementation at the expense of other containers. Julia does not treat arrays in any special way. The array library is implemented almost completely in Julia itself, and derives its performance from the compiler, just like any other code written in Julia. As such, it\'s also possible to define custom array types by inheriting from AbstractArray. See the manual section on the AbstractArray interface for more details on implementing a custom array type.An array is a collection of objects stored in a multi-dimensional grid. In the most general case, an array may contain objects of type Any. For most computational purposes, arrays should contain objects of a more specific type, such as Float64 or Int32.In general, unlike many other technical computing languages, Julia does not expect programs to be written in a vectorized style for performance. Julia\'s compiler uses type inference and generates optimized code for scalar array indexing, allowing programs to be written in a style that is convenient and readable, without sacrificing performance, and using less memory at times.In Julia, all arguments to functions are passed by sharing (i.e. by pointers). Some technical computing languages pass arrays by value, and while this prevents accidental modification by callees of a value in the caller, it makes avoiding unwanted copying of arrays difficult. By convention, a function name ending with a ! indicates that it will mutate or destroy the value of one or more of its arguments (see, for example, sort and sort!. Callees must make explicit copies to ensure that they don\'t modify inputs that they don\'t intend to change. Many non- mutating functions are implemented by calling a function of the same name with an added ! at the end on an explicit copy of the input, and returning that copy."

Values can be specified as any iterable object, but will commonly be ranges like 1:n or 2:(n-1), or explicit arrays of values like [1.2, 3.4, 5.7].

Otherwise, X is an array with the same number of dimensions as the sum of the dimensionalities of all the indices.If all indices are vectors, for example, then the shape of X would be (length(I_1), length(I_2), ..., length(I_n)), with location (i_1, i_2, ..., i_n) of X containing the value A[I_1[i_1], I_2[i_2], ..., I_n[i_n]].Example:julia> A = reshape(collect(1:16), (2, 2, 2, 2))\n2×2×2×2 Array{Int64,4}:\n[:, :, 1, 1] =\n 1  3\n 2  4\n\n[:, :, 2, 1] =\n 5  7\n 6  8\n\n[:, :, 1, 2] =\n  9  11\n 10  12\n\n[:, :, 2, 2] =\n 13  15\n 14  16\n\njulia> A[1, 2, 1, 1] # all scalar indices\n3\n\njulia> A[[1, 2], [1], [1, 2], [1]] # all vector indices\n2×1×2×1 Array{Int64,4}:\n[:, :, 1, 1] =\n 1\n 2\n\n[:, :, 2, 1] =\n 5\n 6\n\njulia> A[[1, 2], [1], [1, 2], 1] # a mix of index types\n2×1×2 Array{Int64,3}:\n[:, :, 1] =\n 1\n 2\n\n[:, :, 2] =\n 5\n 6Note how the size of the resulting array is different in the last two cases.If I_1 is changed to a two-dimensional matrix, then X becomes an n+1-dimensional array of shape (size(I_1, 1), size(I_1, 2), length(I_2), ..., length(I_n)).

All dimensions indexed with scalars are dropped. For example, the result of A[2, I, 3] is an array with size size(I). Its ith element is populated by A[2, I[i], 3].As a special part of this syntax, the end keyword may be used to represent the last index of each dimension within the indexing brackets, as determined by the size of the innermost array being indexed.

    "text": "The special CartesianIndex{N} object represents a scalar index that behaves like an N-tuple of integers spanning multiple dimensions.  For example:julia> A = reshape(1:32, 4, 4, 2);\n\njulia> A[3, 2, 1]\n7\n\njulia> A[CartesianIndex(3, 2, 1)] == A[3, 2, 1] == 7\ntrueConsidered alone, this may seem relatively trivial; CartesianIndex simply gathers multiple integers together into one object that represents a single multidimensional index. When combined with other indexing forms and iterators that yield CartesianIndexes, however, this can lead directly to very elegant and efficient code. See Iteration below, and for some more advanced examples, see this blog post on multidimensional algorithms and iteration.Arrays of CartesianIndex{N} are also supported. They represent a collection of scalar indices that each span N dimensions, enabling a form of indexing that is sometimes referred to as pointwise indexing. For example, it enables accessing the diagonal elements from the first \"page\" of A from above:julia> page = A[:,:,1]\n4×4 Array{Int64,2}:\n 1  5   9  13\n 2  6  10  14\n 3  7  11  15\n 4  8  12  16\n\njulia> page[[CartesianIndex(1,1),\n             CartesianIndex(2,2),\n             CartesianIndex(3,3),\n             CartesianIndex(4,4)]]\n4-element Array{Int64,1}:\n  1\n  6\n 11\n 16This can be expressed much more simply with dot broadcasting and by combining it with a normal integer index (instead of extracting the first page from A as a separate step). It can even be combined with a : to extract both diagonals from the two pages at the same time:julia> A[CartesianIndex.(axes(A, 1), axes(A, 2)), 1]\n4-element Array{Int64,1}:\n  1\n  6\n 11\n 16\n\njulia> A[CartesianIndex.(axes(A, 1), axes(A, 2)), :]\n4×2 Array{Int64,2}:\n  1  17\n  6  22\n 11  27\n 16  32warning: Warning\nCartesianIndex and arrays of CartesianIndex are not compatible with the end keyword to represent the last index of a dimension.

Indexing by a boolean vector B is effectively the same as indexing by the vector of integers that is returned by findall(B). Similarly, indexing by a N-dimensional boolean array is effectively the same as indexing by the vector of CartesianIndex{N}s where its values are true. A logical index must be a vector of the same length as the dimension it indexes into, or it must be the only index provided and match the size and dimensionality of the array it indexes into.

For example, [1, 2] + 3 == [4, 5] and [6, 4] / 2 == [3, 2].Additionally, to enable convenient vectorization of mathematical and other operations, Julia provides the dot syntax f.(args...), e.g. sin.(x) or min.(x,y), for elementwise operations over arrays or mixtures of arrays and scalars (a Broadcasting operation); these have the additional advantage of \"fusing\" into a single loop when combined with other dot calls, e.g. sin.(cos.(x)).Also, every binary operator supports a dot version that can be applied to arrays (and combinations of arrays and scalars) in such fused broadcasting operations, e.g. z .== sin.(x .* y).Note that comparisons such as == operate on whole arrays, giving a single boolean answer. Use dot operators like .== for elementwise comparisons. (For comparison operations like <, only the elementwise .< version is applicable to arrays.)Also notice the difference between max.(a,b), which broadcasts max elementwise over a and b, and maximum(a), which finds the largest value within a.

    "category": "section",
    "text": "The base array type in Julia is the abstract type AbstractArray{T,N}. It is parametrized by the number of dimensions N and the element type T. AbstractVector and AbstractMatrix are aliases for the 1-d and 2-d cases. Operations on AbstractArray objects are defined using higher level operators and functions, in a way that is independent of the underlying storage. These operations generally work correctly as a fallback for any specific array implementation.The AbstractArray type includes anything vaguely array-like, and implementations of it might be quite different from conventional arrays. For example, elements might be computed on request rather than stored. However, any concrete AbstractArray{T,N} type should generally implement at least size(A) (returning an Int tuple), getindex(A,i) and getindex(A,i1,...,iN); mutable arrays should also implement setindex!. It is recommended that these operations have nearly constant time complexity, or technically Õ(1) complexity, as otherwise some array functions may be unexpectedly slow. Concrete types should also typically provide a similar(A,T=eltype(A),dims=size(A)) method, which is used to allocate a similar array for copy and other out-of-place operations. No matter how an AbstractArray{T,N} is represented internally, T is the type of object returned by integer indexing (A[1, ..., 1], when A is not empty) and N should be the length of the tuple returned by size. For more details on defining custom AbstractArray implementations, see the array interface guide in the interfaces chapter.DenseArray is an abstract subtype of AbstractArray intended to include all arrays where elements are stored contiguously in column-major order (see additional notes in Performance Tips). The Array type is a specific instance of DenseArray  Vector and Matrix are aliases for the 1-d and 2-d cases. Very few operations are implemented specifically for Array beyond those that are required for all AbstractArrayss; much of the array library is implemented in a generic manner that allows all custom arrays to behave similarly.SubArray is a specialization of AbstractArray that performs indexing by sharing memory with the original array rather than by copying it. A SubArray is created with the view function, which is called the same way as getindex (with an array and a series of index arguments). The result of view looks the same as the result of getindex, except the data is left in place. view stores the input index vectors in a SubArray object, which can later be used to index the original array indirectly.  By putting the @views macro in front of an expression or block of code, any array[...] slice in that expression will be converted to create a SubArray view instead.BitArrays are space-efficient \"packed\" boolean arrays, which store one bit per boolean value. They can be used similarly to Array{Bool} arrays (which store one byte per boolean value), and can be converted to/from the latter via Array(bitarray) and BitArray(array), respectively.A \"strided\" array is stored in memory with elements laid out in regular offsets such that an instance with a supported isbits element type can be passed to external C and Fortran functions that expect this memory layout. Strided arrays must define a strides(A) method that returns a tuple of \"strides\" for each dimension; a provided stride(A,k) method accesses the kth element within this tuple. Increasing the index of dimension k by 1 should increase the index i of getindex(A,i) by stride(A,k). If a pointer conversion method Base.unsafe_convert(Ptr{T}, A) is provided, the memory layout must correspond in the same way to these strides. DenseArray is a very specific example of a strided array where the elements are arranged contiguously, thus it provides its subtypes with the approporiate definition of strides. More concrete examples can be found within the interface guide for strided arrays. StridedVector and StridedMatrix are convenient aliases for many of the builtin array types that are considered strided arrays, allowing them to dispatch to select specialized implementations that call highly tuned and optimized BLAS and LAPACK functions using just the pointer and strides.The following example computes the QR decomposition of a small section of a larger array, without creating any temporaries, and by calling the appropriate LAPACK function with the right leading dimension size and stride parameters.julia> a = rand(10, 10)\n10×10 Array{Float64,2}:\n 0.517515  0.0348206  0.749042   0.0979679  …  0.75984     0.950481   0.579513\n 0.901092  0.873479   0.134533   0.0697848     0.0586695   0.193254   0.726898\n 0.976808  0.0901881  0.208332   0.920358      0.288535    0.705941   0.337137\n 0.657127  0.0317896  0.772837   0.534457      0.0966037   0.700694   0.675999\n 0.471777  0.144969   0.0718405  0.0827916     0.527233    0.173132   0.694304\n 0.160872  0.455168   0.489254   0.827851   …  0.62226     0.0995456  0.946522\n 0.291857  0.769492   0.68043    0.629461      0.727558    0.910796   0.834837\n 0.775774  0.700731   0.700177   0.0126213     0.00822304  0.327502   0.955181\n 0.9715    0.64354    0.848441   0.241474      0.591611    0.792573   0.194357\n 0.646596  0.575456   0.0995212  0.038517      0.709233    0.477657   0.0507231\n\njulia> b = view(a, 2:2:8,2:2:4)\n4×2 view(::Array{Float64,2}, 2:2:8, 2:2:4) with eltype Float64:\n 0.873479   0.0697848\n 0.0317896  0.534457\n 0.455168   0.827851\n 0.700731   0.0126213\n\njulia> (q, r) = qr(b);\n\njulia> q\n4×4 LinearAlgebra.QRCompactWYQ{Float64,Array{Float64,2}}:\n -0.722358    0.227524  -0.247784    -0.604181\n -0.0262896  -0.575919  -0.804227     0.144377\n -0.376419   -0.75072    0.540177    -0.0541979\n -0.579497    0.230151  -0.00552346   0.781782\n\njulia> r\n2×2 Array{Float64,2}:\n -1.20921  -0.383393\n  0.0      -0.910506"

This abstract definition actually corresponds to a relatively natural behavior which is best explained via concrete examples.Let us illustrate this principle with the logical \"or\" operator |.

Now, as you can see from this example, write takes the data to write as its second argument, while read takes the type of the data to be read as the second argument.For example, to read a simple byte array, we could do:julia> x = zeros(UInt8, 4)\n4-element Array{UInt8,1}:\n 0x00\n 0x00\n 0x00\n 0x00\n\njulia> read!(stdin, x)\nabcd\n4-element Array{UInt8,1}:\n 0x61\n 0x62\n 0x63\n 0x64However, since this is slightly cumbersome, there are several convenience methods provided. For example, we could have written the above as:julia> read(stdin, 4)\nabcd\n4-element Array{UInt8,1}:\n 0x61\n 0x62\n 0x63\n 0x64or if we had wanted to read the entire line instead:julia> readline(stdin)\nabcd\n\"abcd\"Note that depending on your terminal settings, your TTY may be line buffered and might thus require an additional enter before the data is sent to Julia.To read every line from stdin you can use eachline:for line in eachline(stdin)\n    print(\"Found $line\")\nendor read if you wanted to read by character instead:while !eof(stdin)\n    x = read(stdin, Char)\n    println(\"Found: $x\")\nend"

This is because the IOStream must be closed before the write is actually flushed to disk:julia> close(f)Examining hello.txt again will show its contents have been changed.Opening a file, doing something to its contents, and closing it again is a very common pattern. To make this easier, there exists another invocation of open which takes a function as its first argument and filename as its second, opens the file, calls the function with the file as an argument, and then closes it again. For example, given a function:function read_and_capitalize(f::IOStream)\n    return uppercase(read(f, String))\nendYou can call:julia> open(read_and_capitalize, \"hello.txt\")\n\"HELLO AGAIN.\"to open hello.txt, call read_and_capitalize on it, close hello.txt and return the capitalized contents.To avoid even having to define a named function, you can use the do syntax, which creates an anonymous function on the fly:julia> open(\"hello.txt\") do f\n           uppercase(read(f, String))\n       end\n\"HELLO AGAIN.\""

    "category": "section",
    "text": "Let\'s jump right in with a simple example involving TCP sockets. This functionality is in a standard library package called Sockets. Let\'s first create a simple server:julia> using Sockets\n\njulia> @async begin\n           server = listen(2000)\n           while true\n               sock = accept(server)\n               println(\"Hello World\\n\")\n           end\n       end\nTask (runnable) @0x00007fd31dc11ae0To those familiar with the Unix socket API, the method names will feel familiar, though their usage is somewhat simpler than the raw Unix socket API. The first call to listen will create a server waiting for incoming connections on the specified port (2000) in this case. The same function may also be used to create various other kinds of servers:julia> listen(2000) # Listens on localhost:2000 (IPv4)\nBase.TCPServer(active)\n\njulia> listen(ip\"127.0.0.1\",2000) # Equivalent to the first\nBase.TCPServer(active)\n\njulia> listen(ip\"::1\",2000) # Listens on localhost:2000 (IPv6)\nBase.TCPServer(active)\n\njulia> listen(IPv4(0),2001) # Listens on port 2001 on all IPv4 interfaces\nBase.TCPServer(active)\n\njulia> listen(IPv6(0),2001) # Listens on port 2001 on all IPv6 interfaces\nBase.TCPServer(active)\n\njulia> listen(\"testsocket\") # Listens on a UNIX domain socket\nBase.PipeServer(active)\n\njulia> listen(\"\\\\\\\\.\\\\pipe\\\\testsocket\") # Listens on a Windows named pipe\nBase.PipeServer(active)Note that the return type of the last invocation is different. This is because this server does not listen on TCP, but rather on a named pipe (Windows) or UNIX domain socket. Also note that Windows named pipe format has to be a specific pattern such that the name prefix (\\\\.\\pipe\\) uniquely identifies the file type. The difference between TCP and named pipes or UNIX domain sockets is subtle and has to do with the accept and connect methods. The accept method retrieves a connection to the client that is connecting on the server we just created, while the connect function connects to a server using the specified method. The connect function takes the same arguments as listen, so, assuming the environment (i.e. host, cwd, etc.) is the same you should be able to pass the same arguments to connect as you did to listen to establish the connection. So let\'s try that out (after having created the server above):julia> connect(2000)\nTCPSocket(open, 0 bytes waiting)\n\njulia> Hello WorldAs expected we saw \"Hello World\" printed. So, let\'s actually analyze what happened behind the scenes. When we called connect, we connect to the server we had just created. Meanwhile, the accept function returns a server-side connection to the newly created socket and prints \"Hello World\" to indicate that the connection was successful.A great strength of Julia is that since the API is exposed synchronously even though the I/O is actually happening asynchronously, we didn\'t have to worry about callbacks or even making sure that the server gets to run. When we called connect the current task waited for the connection to be established and only continued executing after that was done. In this pause, the server task resumed execution (because a connection request was now available), accepted the connection, printed the message and waited for the next client. Reading and writing works in the same way. To see this, consider the following simple echo server:julia> @async begin\n           server = listen(2001)\n           while true\n               sock = accept(server)\n               @async while isopen(sock)\n                   write(sock, readline(sock, keep=true))\n               end\n           end\n       end\nTask (runnable) @0x00007fd31dc12e60\n\njulia> clientside = connect(2001)\nTCPSocket(RawFD(28) open, 0 bytes waiting)\n\njulia> @async while isopen(clientside)\n           write(stdout, readline(clientside, keep=true))\n       end\nTask (runnable) @0x00007fd31dc11870\n\njulia> println(clientside,\"Hello World from the Echo Server\")\nHello World from the Echo ServerAs with other streams, use close to disconnect the socket:julia> close(clientside)"

We can divide them in three main categories :Julia Coroutines (Green Threading)\nMulti-Threading\nMulti-Core or Distributed ProcessingWe will first consider Julia Tasks (aka Coroutines) and other modules that rely on the Julia runtime library, that allow to suspend and resume computations with full control of inter-Tasks communication without having to manually interface with the operative system\'s scheduler. Julia also allows to communicate between Tasks through operations like wait and fetch. Communication and data synchronization is managed through Channels, which are the conduit that allows inter-Tasks communication.Julia also supports experimental multi-threading, where execution is forked and an anonymous function is run across all threads. Described as a fork-join approach, parallel threads are branched off and they all have to join the Julia main thread to make serial execution continue. Multi-threading is supported using the Base.Threads module that is still considered experimental, as Julia is not fully thread-safe yet. In particular segfaults seem to emerge for I\\O operations and task switching. As an un up-to-date reference, keep an eye on the issue tracker. Multi-Threading should only be used if you take into consideration global variables, locks and atomics, so we will explain it later.In the end we will present Julia\'s way to distributed and parallel computing. With scientific computing in mind, Julia natively implements interfaces to distribute a process through multiple cores or machines. Also we will mention useful external packages for distributed programming like MPI.jl and DistributedArrays.jl."

    "text": "Julia\'s parallel programming platform uses Tasks (aka Coroutines) to switch among multiple computations. To express an order of execution between lightweight threads communication primitives are necessary. Julia offers Channel(func::Function, ctype=Any, csize=0, taskref=nothing) that creates a new task from func, binds it to a new channel of type ctype and size csize and schedule the task. Channels can serve as a way to communicate between tasks, as Channel{T}(sz::Int) creates a buffered channel of type T and size sz. Whenever code performs a communication operation like fetch or wait, the current task is suspended and a scheduler picks another task to run. A task is restarted when the event it is waiting for completes.For many problems, it is not necessary to think about tasks directly. However, they can be used to wait for multiple events at the same time, which provides for dynamic scheduling. In dynamic scheduling, a program decides what to compute or where to compute it based on when other jobs finish. This is needed for unpredictable or unbalanced workloads, where we want to assign more work to processes only when they finish their current tasks."

    "title": "Channels",
    "category": "section",
    "text": "The section on Tasks in Control Flow discussed the execution of multiple functions in a co-operative manner. Channels can be quite useful to pass data between running tasks, particularly those involving I/O operations.Examples of operations involving I/O include reading/writing to files, accessing web services, executing external programs, etc. In all these cases, overall execution time can be improved if other tasks can be run while a file is being read, or while waiting for an external service/program to complete.A channel can be visualized as a pipe, i.e., it has a write end and a read end :Multiple writers in different tasks can write to the same channel concurrently via put! calls.\nMultiple readers in different tasks can read data concurrently via take! calls.\nAs an example:\n# Given Channels c1 and c2,\nc1 = Channel(32)\nc2 = Channel(32)\n\n# and a function `foo` which reads items from from c1, processes the item read\n# and writes a result to c2,\nfunction foo()\n    while true\n        data = take!(c1)\n        [...]               # process data\n        put!(c2, result)    # write out result\n    end\nend\n\n# we can schedule `n` instances of `foo` to be active concurrently.\nfor _ in 1:n\n    @schedule foo()\nend\nChannels are created via the Channel{T}(sz) constructor. The channel will only hold objectsof type T. If the type is not specified, the channel can hold objects of any type. sz refers   to the maximum number of elements that can be held in the channel at any time. For example, Channel(32)   creates a channel that can hold a maximum of 32 objects of any type. A Channel{MyType}(64) can   hold up to 64 objects of MyType at any time.If a Channel is empty, readers (on a take! call) will block until data is available.\nIf a Channel is full, writers (on a put! call) will block until space becomes available.\nisready tests for the presence of any object in the channel, while wait waits for an object to become available.\nA Channel is in an open state initially. This means that it can be read from and written to freely via take! and put! calls. close closes a Channel. On a closed Channel, put! will fail. For example:julia> c = Channel(2);\n\njulia> put!(c, 1) # `put!` on an open channel succeeds\n1\n\njulia> close(c);\n\njulia> put!(c, 2) # `put!` on a closed channel throws an exception.\nERROR: InvalidStateException(\"Channel is closed.\",:closed)\nStacktrace:\n[...]take! and fetch (which retrieves but does not remove the value) on a closed channel successfully return any existing values until it is emptied. Continuing the above example:julia> fetch(c) # Any number of `fetch` calls succeed.\n1\n\njulia> fetch(c)\n1\n\njulia> take!(c) # The first `take!` removes the value.\n1\n\njulia> take!(c) # No more data available on a closed channel.\nERROR: InvalidStateException(\"Channel is closed.\",:closed)\nStacktrace:\n[...]A Channel can be used as an iterable object in a for loop, in which case the loop runs as long as the Channel has data or is open. The loop variable takes on all values added to the Channel. The for loop is terminated once the Channel is closed and emptied.For example, the following would cause the for loop to wait for more data:julia> c = Channel{Int}(10);\n\njulia> foreach(i->put!(c, i), 1:3) # add a few entries\n\njulia> data = [i for i in c]while this will return after reading all data:julia> c = Channel{Int}(10);\n\njulia> foreach(i->put!(c, i), 1:3); # add a few entries\n\njulia> close(c);                    # `for` loops can exit\n\njulia> data = [i for i in c]\n3-element Array{Int64,1}:\n 1\n 2\n 3Consider a simple example using channels for inter-task communication. We start 4 tasks to process data from a single jobs channel. Jobs, identified by an id (job_id), are written to the channel. Each task in this simulation reads a job_id, waits for a random amout of time and writes back a tuple of job_id and the simulated time to the results channel. Finally all the results are printed out.julia> const jobs = Channel{Int}(32);\n\njulia> const results = Channel{Tuple}(32);\n\njulia> function do_work()\n           for job_id in jobs\n               exec_time = rand()\n               sleep(exec_time)                # simulates elapsed time doing actual work\n                                               # typically performed externally.\n               put!(results, (job_id, exec_time))\n           end\n       end;\n\njulia> function make_jobs(n)\n           for i in 1:n\n               put!(jobs, i)\n           end\n       end;\n\njulia> n = 12;\n\njulia> @schedule make_jobs(n); # feed the jobs channel with \"n\" jobs\n\njulia> for i in 1:4 # start 4 tasks to process requests in parallel\n           @schedule do_work()\n       end\n\njulia> @elapsed while n > 0 # print out results\n           job_id, exec_time = take!(results)\n           println(\"$job_id finished in $(round(exec_time,2)) seconds\")\n           n = n - 1\n       end\n4 finished in 0.22 seconds\n3 finished in 0.45 seconds\n1 finished in 0.5 seconds\n7 finished in 0.14 seconds\n2 finished in 0.78 seconds\n5 finished in 0.9 seconds\n9 finished in 0.36 seconds\n6 finished in 0.87 seconds\n8 finished in 0.79 seconds\n10 finished in 0.64 seconds\n12 finished in 0.5 seconds\n11 finished in 0.97 seconds\n0.029772311The current version of Julia multiplexes all tasks onto a single OS thread. Thus, while tasks involving I/O operations benefit from parallel execution, compute bound tasks are effectively executed sequentially on a single OS thread. Future versions of Julia may support scheduling of tasks on multiple threads, in which case compute bound tasks will see benefits of parallel execution too."

    "text": "All I/O tasks, timers, REPL commands, etc are multiplexed onto a single OS thread via an event loop. A patched version of libuv (http://docs.libuv.org/en/v1.x/) provides this functionality. Yield points provide for co-operatively scheduling multiple tasks onto the same OS thread. I/O tasks and timers yield implicitly while waiting for the event to occur. Calling yield explicitly allows for other tasks to be scheduled.Thus, a task executing a ccall effectively prevents the Julia scheduler from executing any other tasks till the call returns. This is true for all calls into external libraries. Exceptions are calls into custom C code that call back into Julia (which may then yield) or C code that calls jl_yield() (C equivalent of yield).Note that while Julia code runs on a single thread (by default), libraries used by Julia may launch their own internal threads. For example, the BLAS library may start as many threads as there are cores on a machine.The @threadcall macro addresses scenarios where we do not want a ccall to block the main Julia event loop. It schedules a C function for execution in a separate thread. A threadpool with a default size of 4 is used for this. The size of the threadpool is controlled via environment variable UV_THREADPOOL_SIZE. While waiting for a free thread, and during function execution once a thread is available, the requesting task (on the main Julia event loop) yields to other tasks. Note that @threadcall does not return till the execution is complete. From a user point of view, it is therefore a blocking call like other Julia APIs.It is very important that the called function does not call back into Julia, as it will segfault.@threadcall may be removed/changed in future versions of Julia."

    "text": "An implementation of distributed memory parallel computing is provided by module Distributed as part of the standard library shipped with Julia.Most modern computers possess more than one CPU, and several computers can be combined together in a cluster. Harnessing the power of these multiple CPUs allows many computations to be completed more quickly. There are two major factors that influence performance: the speed of the CPUs themselves, and the speed of their access to memory. In a cluster, it\'s fairly obvious that a given CPU will have fastest access to the RAM within the same computer (node). Perhaps more surprisingly, similar issues are relevant on a typical multicore laptop, due to differences in the speed of main memory and the cache. Consequently, a good multiprocessing environment should allow control over the \"ownership\" of a chunk of memory by a particular CPU. Julia provides a multiprocessing environment based on message passing to allow programs to run on multiple processes in separate memory domains at once.Julia\'s implementation of message passing is different from other environments such as MPI [1]. Communication in Julia is generally \"one-sided\", meaning that the programmer needs to explicitly manage only one process in a two-process operation. Furthermore, these operations typically do not look like \"message send\" and \"message receive\" but rather resemble higher-level operations like calls to user functions.Distributed programming in Julia is built on two primitives: remote references and remote calls. A remote reference is an object that can be used from any process to refer to an object stored on a particular process. A remote call is a request by one process to call a certain function on certain arguments on another (possibly the same) process.Remote references come in two flavors: Future and RemoteChannel.A remote call returns a Future to its result. Remote calls return immediately; the process that made the call proceeds to its next operation while the remote call happens somewhere else. You can wait for a remote call to finish by calling wait on the returned Future, and you can obtain the full value of the result using fetch.On the other hand, RemoteChannel s are rewritable. For example, multiple processes can co-ordinate their processing by referencing the same remote Channel.Each process has an associated identifier. The process providing the interactive Julia prompt always has an id equal to 1. The processes used by default for parallel operations are referred to as \"workers\". When there is only one process, process 1 is considered a worker. Otherwise, workers are considered to be all processes other than process 1.Let\'s try this out. Starting with julia -p n provides n worker processes on the local machine. Generally it makes sense for n to equal the number of CPU threads (logical cores) on the machine. Note that the -p argument implicitly loads module Distributed.$ ./julia -p 2\n\njulia> r = remotecall(rand, 2, 2, 2)\nFuture(2, 1, 4, nothing)\n\njulia> s = @spawnat 2 1 .+ fetch(r)\nFuture(2, 1, 5, nothing)\n\njulia> fetch(s)\n2×2 Array{Float64,2}:\n 1.18526  1.50912\n 1.16296  1.60607The first argument to remotecall is the function to call. Most parallel programming in Julia does not reference specific processes or the number of processes available, but remotecall is considered a low-level interface providing finer control. The second argument to remotecall is the id of the process that will do the work, and the remaining arguments will be passed to the function being called.As you can see, in the first line we asked process 2 to construct a 2-by-2 random matrix, and in the second line we asked it to add 1 to it. The result of both calculations is available in the two futures, r and s. The @spawnat macro evaluates the expression in the second argument on the process specified by the first argument.Occasionally you might want a remotely-computed value immediately. This typically happens when you read from a remote object to obtain data needed by the next local operation. The function remotecall_fetch exists for this purpose. It is equivalent to fetch(remotecall(...)) but is more efficient.julia> remotecall_fetch(getindex, 2, r, 1, 1)\n0.18526337335308085Remember that getindex(r,1,1) is equivalent to r[1,1], so this call fetches the first element of the future r.The syntax of remotecall is not especially convenient. The macro @spawn makes things easier. It operates on an expression rather than a function, and picks where to do the operation for you:julia> r = @spawn rand(2,2)\nFuture(2, 1, 4, nothing)\n\njulia> s = @spawn 1 .+ fetch(r)\nFuture(3, 1, 5, nothing)\n\njulia> fetch(s)\n2×2 Array{Float64,2}:\n 1.38854  1.9098\n 1.20939  1.57158Note that we used 1 .+ fetch(r) instead of 1 .+ r. This is because we do not know where the code will run, so in general a fetch might be required to move r to the process doing the addition. In this case, @spawn is smart enough to perform the computation on the process that owns r, so the fetch will be a no-op (no work is done).(It is worth noting that @spawn is not built-in but defined in Julia as a macro. It is possible to define your own such constructs.)An important thing to remember is that, once fetched, a Future will cache its value locally. Further fetch calls do not entail a network hop. Once all referencing Futures have fetched, the remote stored value is deleted.@async is similar to @spawn, but only runs tasks on the local process. We use it to create a \"feeder\" task for each process. Each task picks the next index that needs to be computed, then waits for its process to finish, then repeats until we run out of indices. Note that the feeder tasks do not begin to execute until the main task reaches the end of the @sync block, at which point it surrenders control and waits for all the local tasks to complete before returning from the function. As for v0.7 and beyond, the feeder tasks are able to share state via nextidx because they all run on the same process. Even if Tasks are scheduled cooperatively, locking may still be required in some contexts, as in asynchronous I\\O. This means context switches only occur at well-defined points: in this case, when remotecall_fetch is called. This is the current state of implementation (dev v0.7) and it may change for future Julia versions, as it is intended to make it possible to run up to N Tasks on M Process, aka M:N Threading. Then a lock acquiring\\releasing model for nextidx will be needed, as it is not safe to let multiple processes read-write a resource at the same time."

    "text": "Sending messages and moving data constitute most of the overhead in a distributed program. Reducing the number of messages and the amount of data sent is critical to achieving performance and scalability. To this end, it is important to understand the data movement performed by Julia\'s various distributed programming constructs.fetch can be considered an explicit data movement operation, since it directly asks that an object be moved to the local machine. @spawn (and a few related constructs) also moves data, but this is not as obvious, hence it can be called an implicit data movement operation. Consider these two approaches to constructing and squaring a random matrix:Method 1:julia> A = rand(1000,1000);\n\njulia> Bref = @spawn A^2;\n\n[...]\n\njulia> fetch(Bref);Method 2:julia> Bref = @spawn rand(1000,1000)^2;\n\n[...]\n\njulia> fetch(Bref);The difference seems trivial, but in fact is quite significant due to the behavior of @spawn. In the first method, a random matrix is constructed locally, then sent to another process where it is squared. In the second method, a random matrix is both constructed and squared on another process. Therefore the second method sends much less data than the first.In this toy example, the two methods are easy to distinguish and choose from. However, in a real program designing data movement might require more thought and likely some measurement. For example, if the first process needs matrix A then the first method might be better. Or, if computing A is expensive and only the current process has it, then moving it to another process might be unavoidable. Or, if the current process has very little to do between the @spawn and fetch(Bref), it might be better to eliminate the parallelism altogether. Or imagine rand(1000,1000) is replaced with a more expensive operation. Then it might make sense to add another @spawn statement just for this step."

    "title": "Global variables",
    "category": "section",
    "text": "Expressions executed remotely via @spawn, or closures specified for remote execution using remotecall may refer to global variables. Global bindings under module Main are treated a little differently compared to global bindings in other modules. Consider the following code snippet:A = rand(10,10)\nremotecall_fetch(()->sum(A), 2)In this case sum MUST be defined in the remote process. Note that A is a global variable defined in the local workspace. Worker 2 does not have a variable called A under Main. The act of shipping the closure ()->sum(A) to worker 2 results in Main.A being defined on 2. Main.A continues to exist on worker 2 even after the call remotecall_fetch returns. Remote calls with embedded global references (under Main module only) manage globals as follows:New global bindings are created on destination workers if they are referenced as part of a remote call.\nGlobal constants are declared as constants on remote nodes too.\nGlobals are re-sent to a destination worker only in the context of a remote call, and then only if its value has changed. Also, the cluster does not synchronize global bindings across nodes. For example:\nA = rand(10,10)\nremotecall_fetch(()->sum(A), 2) # worker 2\nA = rand(10,10)\nremotecall_fetch(()->sum(A), 3) # worker 3\nA = nothing\nExecuting the above snippet results in Main.A on worker 2 having a different value from Main.A on worker 3, while the value of Main.A on node 1 is set to nothing.As you may have realized, while memory associated with globals may be collected when they are reassigned on the master, no such action is taken on the workers as the bindings continue to be valid. clear! can be used to manually reassign specific globals on remote nodes to nothing once they are no longer required. This will release any memory associated with them as part of a regular garbage collection cycle.Thus programs should be careful referencing globals in remote calls. In fact, it is preferable to avoid them altogether if possible. If you must reference globals, consider using let blocks to localize global variables.For example:julia> A = rand(10,10);\n\njulia> remotecall_fetch(()->A, 2);\n\njulia> B = rand(10,10);\n\njulia> let B = B\n           remotecall_fetch(()->B, 2)\n       end;\n\njulia> @fetchfrom 2 varinfo()\nname           size summary\n––––––––– ––––––––– ––––––––––––––––––––––\nA         800 bytes 10×10 Array{Float64,2}\nBase                Module\nCore                Module\nMain                ModuleAs can be seen, global variable A is defined on worker 2, but B is captured as a local variable and hence a binding for B does not exist on worker 2."

    "text": "Fortunately, many useful parallel computations do not require data movement. A common example is a Monte Carlo simulation, where multiple processes can handle independent simulation trials simultaneously. We can use @spawn to flip coins on two processes. First, write the following function in count_heads.jl:function count_heads(n)\n    c::Int = 0\n    for i = 1:n\n        c += rand(Bool)\n    end\n    c\nendThe function count_heads simply adds together n random bits. Here is how we can perform some trials on two machines, and add together the results:julia> @everywhere include_string(Main, $(read(\"count_heads.jl\", String)), \"count_heads.jl\")\n\njulia> a = @spawn count_heads(100000000)\nFuture(2, 1, 6, nothing)\n\njulia> b = @spawn count_heads(100000000)\nFuture(3, 1, 7, nothing)\n\njulia> fetch(a)+fetch(b)\n100001564This example demonstrates a powerful and often-used parallel programming pattern. Many iterations run independently over several processes, and then their results are combined using some function. The combination process is called a reduction, since it is generally tensor-rank-reducing: a vector of numbers is reduced to a single number, or a matrix is reduced to a single row or column, etc. In code, this typically looks like the pattern x = f(x,v[i]), where x is the accumulator, f is the reduction function, and the v[i] are the elements being reduced. It is desirable for f to be associative, so that it does not matter what order the operations are performed in.Notice that our use of this pattern with count_heads can be generalized. We used two explicit @spawn statements, which limits the parallelism to two processes. To run on any number of processes, we can use a parallel for loop, running in distributed memory, which can be written in Julia using @distributed like this:nheads = @distributed (+) for i = 1:200000000\n    Int(rand(Bool))\nendThis construct implements the pattern of assigning iterations to multiple processes, and combining them with a specified reduction (in this case (+)). The result of each iteration is taken as the value of the last expression inside the loop. The whole parallel loop expression itself evaluates to the final answer.Note that although parallel for loops look like serial for loops, their behavior is dramatically different. In particular, the iterations do not happen in a specified order, and writes to variables or arrays will not be globally visible since iterations run on different processes. Any variables used inside the parallel loop will be copied and broadcast to each process.For example, the following code will not work as intended:a = zeros(100000)\n@distributed for i = 1:100000\n    a[i] = i\nendThis code will not initialize all of a, since each process will have a separate copy of it. Parallel for loops like these must be avoided. Fortunately, Shared Arrays can be used to get around this limitation:using SharedArrays\n\na = SharedArray{Float64}(10)\n@distributed for i = 1:10\n    a[i] = i\nendUsing \"outside\" variables in parallel loops is perfectly reasonable if the variables are read-only:a = randn(1000)\n@distributed (+) for i = 1:100000\n    f(a[rand(1:end)])\nendHere each iteration applies f to a randomly-chosen sample from a vector a shared by all processes.As you could see, the reduction operator can be omitted if it is not needed. In that case, the loop executes asynchronously, i.e. it spawns independent tasks on all available workers and returns an array of Future immediately without waiting for completion. The caller can wait for the Future completions at a later point by calling fetch on them, or wait for completion at the end of the loop by prefixing it with @sync, like @sync @distributed for.In some cases no reduction operator is needed, and we merely wish to apply a function to all integers in some range (or, more generally, to all elements in some collection). This is another useful operation called parallel map, implemented in Julia as the pmap function. For example, we could compute the singular values of several large random matrices in parallel as follows:julia> M = Matrix{Float64}[rand(1000,1000) for i = 1:10];\n\njulia> pmap(svdvals, M);Julia\'s pmap is designed for the case where each function call does a large amount of work. In contrast, @distributed for can handle situations where each iteration is tiny, perhaps merely summing two numbers. Only worker processes are used by both pmap and @distributed for for the parallel computation. In case of @distributed for, the final reduction is done on the calling process."

    "text": "Objects referred to by remote references can be freed only when all held references in the cluster are deleted.The node where the value is stored keeps track of which of the workers have a reference to it. Every time a RemoteChannel or a (unfetched) Future is serialized to a worker, the node pointed to by the reference is notified. And every time a RemoteChannel or a (unfetched) Future is garbage collected locally, the node owning the value is again notified. This is implemented in an internal cluster aware serializer. Remote references are only valid in the context of a running cluster. Serializing and deserializing references to and from regular IO objects is not supported.The notifications are done via sending of \"tracking\" messages–an \"add reference\" message when a reference is serialized to a different process and a \"delete reference\" message when a reference is locally garbage collected.Since Futures are write-once and cached locally, the act of fetching a Future also updates reference tracking information on the node owning the value.The node which owns the value frees it once all references to it are cleared.With Futures, serializing an already fetched Future to a different node also sends the value since the original remote store may have collected the value by this time.It is important to note that when an object is locally garbage collected depends on the size of the object and the current memory pressure in the system.In case of remote references, the size of the local reference object is quite small, while the value stored on the remote node may be quite large. Since the local object may not be collected immediately, it is a good practice to explicitly call finalize on local instances of a RemoteChannel, or on unfetched Futures. Since calling fetch on a Future also removes its reference from the remote store, this is not required on fetched Futures. Explicitly calling finalize results in an immediate message sent to the remote node to go ahead and remove its reference to the value.Once finalized, a reference becomes invalid and cannot be used in any further calls."

    "title": "Shared Arrays",
    "category": "section",
    "text": "Shared Arrays use system shared memory to map the same array across many processes. While there are some similarities to a DArray, the behavior of a SharedArray is quite different. In a DArray, each process has local access to just a chunk of the data, and no two processes share the same chunk; in contrast, in a SharedArray each \"participating\" process has access to the entire array.  A SharedArray is a good choice when you want to have a large amount of data jointly accessible to two or more processes on the same machine.Shared Array support is available via module SharedArrays which must be explicitly loaded on all participating workers.SharedArray indexing (assignment and accessing values) works just as with regular arrays, and is efficient because the underlying memory is available to the local process. Therefore, most algorithms work naturally on SharedArrays, albeit in single-process mode. In cases where an algorithm insists on an Array input, the underlying array can be retrieved from a SharedArray by calling sdata. For other AbstractArray types, sdata just returns the object itself, so it\'s safe to use sdata on any Array-type object.The constructor for a shared array is of the form:SharedArray{T,N}(dims::NTuple; init=false, pids=Int[])which creates an N-dimensional shared array of a bits type T and size dims across the processes specified by pids. Unlike distributed arrays, a shared array is accessible only from those participating workers specified by the pids named argument (and the creating process too, if it is on the same host).If an init function, of signature initfn(S::SharedArray), is specified, it is called on all the participating workers. You can specify that each worker runs the init function on a distinct portion of the array, thereby parallelizing initialization.Here\'s a brief example:julia> using Distributed\n\njulia> addprocs(3)\n3-element Array{Int64,1}:\n 2\n 3\n 4\n\njulia> @everywhere using SharedArrays\n\njulia> S = SharedArray{Int,2}((3,4), init = S -> S[localindices(S)] = myid())\n3×4 SharedArray{Int64,2}:\n 2  2  3  4\n 2  3  3  4\n 2  3  4  4\n\njulia> S[3,2] = 7\n7\n\njulia> S\n3×4 SharedArray{Int64,2}:\n 2  2  3  4\n 2  3  3  4\n 2  7  4  4SharedArrays.localindices provides disjoint one-dimensional ranges of indices, and is sometimes convenient for splitting up tasks among processes. You can, of course, divide the work any way you wish:julia> S = SharedArray{Int,2}((3,4), init = S -> S[indexpids(S):length(procs(S)):length(S)] = myid())\n3×4 SharedArray{Int64,2}:\n 2  2  2  2\n 3  3  3  3\n 4  4  4  4Since all processes have access to the underlying data, you do have to be careful not to set up conflicts. For example:@sync begin\n    for p in procs(S)\n        @async begin\n            remotecall_wait(fill!, p, S, p)\n        end\n    end\nendwould result in undefined behavior. Because each process fills the entire array with its own pid, whichever process is the last to execute (for any particular element of S) will have its pid retained.As a more extended and complex example, consider running the following \"kernel\" in parallel:q[i,j,t+1] = q[i,j,t] + u[i,j,t]In this case, if we try to split up the work using a one-dimensional index, we are likely to run into trouble: if q[i,j,t] is near the end of the block assigned to one worker and q[i,j,t+1] is near the beginning of the block assigned to another, it\'s very likely that q[i,j,t] will not be ready at the time it\'s needed for computing q[i,j,t+1]. In such cases, one is better off chunking the array manually. Let\'s split along the second dimension. Define a function that returns the (irange, jrange) indices assigned to this worker:julia> @everywhere function myrange(q::SharedArray)\n           idx = indexpids(q)\n           if idx == 0 # This worker is not assigned a piece\n               return 1:0, 1:0\n           end\n           nchunks = length(procs(q))\n           splits = [round(Int, s) for s in range(0, stop=size(q,2), length=nchunks+1)]\n           1:size(q,1), splits[idx]+1:splits[idx+1]\n       endNext, define the kernel:julia> @everywhere function advection_chunk!(q, u, irange, jrange, trange)\n           @show (irange, jrange, trange)  # display so we can see what\'s happening\n           for t in trange, j in jrange, i in irange\n               q[i,j,t+1] = q[i,j,t] + u[i,j,t]\n           end\n           q\n       endWe also define a convenience wrapper for a SharedArray implementationjulia> @everywhere advection_shared_chunk!(q, u) =\n           advection_chunk!(q, u, myrange(q)..., 1:size(q,3)-1)Now let\'s compare three different versions, one that runs in a single process:julia> advection_serial!(q, u) = advection_chunk!(q, u, 1:size(q,1), 1:size(q,2), 1:size(q,3)-1);one that uses @distributed:julia> function advection_parallel!(q, u)\n           for t = 1:size(q,3)-1\n               @sync @distributed for j = 1:size(q,2)\n                   for i = 1:size(q,1)\n                       q[i,j,t+1]= q[i,j,t] + u[i,j,t]\n                   end\n               end\n           end\n           q\n       end;and one that delegates in chunks:julia> function advection_shared!(q, u)\n           @sync begin\n               for p in procs(q)\n                   @async remotecall_wait(advection_shared_chunk!, p, q, u)\n               end\n           end\n           q\n       end;If we create SharedArrays and time these functions, we get the following results (with julia -p 4):julia> q = SharedArray{Float64,3}((500,500,500));\n\njulia> u = SharedArray{Float64,3}((500,500,500));Run the functions once to JIT-compile and @time them on the second run:julia> @time advection_serial!(q, u);\n(irange,jrange,trange) = (1:500,1:500,1:499)\n 830.220 milliseconds (216 allocations: 13820 bytes)\n\njulia> @time advection_parallel!(q, u);\n   2.495 seconds      (3999 k allocations: 289 MB, 2.09% gc time)\n\njulia> @time advection_shared!(q,u);\n        From worker 2:       (irange,jrange,trange) = (1:500,1:125,1:499)\n        From worker 4:       (irange,jrange,trange) = (1:500,251:375,1:499)\n        From worker 3:       (irange,jrange,trange) = (1:500,126:250,1:499)\n        From worker 5:       (irange,jrange,trange) = (1:500,376:500,1:499)\n 238.119 milliseconds (2264 allocations: 169 KB)The biggest advantage of advection_shared! is that it minimizes traffic among the workers, allowing each to compute for an extended time on the assigned piece."

    "text": "The launching, management and networking of Julia processes into a logical cluster is done via cluster managers. A ClusterManager is responsible forlaunching worker processes in a cluster environment\nmanaging events during the lifetime of each worker\noptionally, providing data transportA Julia cluster has the following characteristics:The initial Julia process, also called the master, is special and has an id of 1.\nOnly the master process can add or remove worker processes.\nAll processes can directly communicate with each other.Connections between workers (using the in-built TCP/IP transport) is established in the following manner:addprocs is called on the master process with a ClusterManager object.\naddprocs calls the appropriate launch method which spawns required number of worker processes on appropriate machines.\nEach worker starts listening on a free port and writes out its host and port information to stdout.\nThe cluster manager captures the stdout of each worker and makes it available to the master process.\nThe master process parses this information and sets up TCP/IP connections to each worker.\nEvery worker is also notified of other workers in the cluster.\nEach worker connects to all workers whose id is less than the worker\'s own id.\nIn this way a mesh network is established, wherein every worker is directly connected with every other worker.While the default transport layer uses plain TCPSocket, it is possible for a Julia cluster to provide its own transport.Julia provides two in-built cluster managers:LocalManager, used when addprocs() or addprocs(np::Integer) are called\nSSHManager, used when addprocs(hostnames::Array) is called with a list of hostnamesLocalManager is used to launch additional workers on the same host, thereby leveraging multi-core and multi-processor hardware.Thus, a minimal cluster manager would need to:be a subtype of the abstract ClusterManager\nimplement launch, a method responsible for launching new workers\nimplement manage, which is called at various events during a worker\'s lifetime (for example, sending an interrupt signal)addprocs(manager::FooManager) requires FooManager to implement:function launch(manager::FooManager, params::Dict, launched::Array, c::Condition)\n    [...]\nend\n\nfunction manage(manager::FooManager, id::Integer, config::WorkerConfig, op::Symbol)\n    [...]\nendAs an example let us see how the LocalManager, the manager responsible for starting workers on the same host, is implemented:struct LocalManager <: ClusterManager\n    np::Integer\nend\n\nfunction launch(manager::LocalManager, params::Dict, launched::Array, c::Condition)\n    [...]\nend\n\nfunction manage(manager::LocalManager, id::Integer, config::WorkerConfig, op::Symbol)\n    [...]\nendThe launch method takes the following arguments:manager::ClusterManager: the cluster manager that addprocs is called with\nparams::Dict: all the keyword arguments passed to addprocs\nlaunched::Array: the array to append one or more WorkerConfig objects to\nc::Condition: the condition variable to be notified as and when workers are launchedThe launch method is called asynchronously in a separate task. The termination of this task signals that all requested workers have been launched. Hence the launch function MUST exit as soon as all the requested workers have been launched.Newly launched workers are connected to each other and the master process in an all-to-all manner. Specifying the command line argument --worker[=<cookie>] results in the launched processes initializing themselves as workers and connections being set up via TCP/IP sockets.All workers in a cluster share the same cookie as the master. When the cookie is unspecified, i.e, with the --worker option, the worker tries to read it from its standard input.  LocalManager and SSHManager both pass the cookie to newly launched workers via their  standard inputs.By default a worker will listen on a free port at the address returned by a call to getipaddr(). A specific address to listen on may be specified by optional argument --bind-to bind_addr[:port]. This is useful for multi-homed hosts.As an example of a non-TCP/IP transport, an implementation may choose to use MPI, in which case --worker must NOT be specified. Instead, newly launched workers should call init_worker(cookie) before using any of the parallel constructs.For every worker launched, the launch method must add a WorkerConfig object (with appropriate fields initialized) to launchedmutable struct WorkerConfig\n    # Common fields relevant to all cluster managers\n    io::Union{IO, Nothing}\n    host::Union{AbstractString, Nothing}\n    port::Union{Integer, Nothing}\n\n    # Used when launching additional workers at a host\n    count::Union{Int, Symbol, Nothing}\n    exename::Union{AbstractString, Cmd, Nothing}\n    exeflags::Union{Cmd, Nothing}\n\n    # External cluster managers can use this to store information at a per-worker level\n    # Can be a dict if multiple fields need to be stored.\n    userdata::Any\n\n    # SSHManager / SSH tunnel connections to workers\n    tunnel::Union{Bool, Nothing}\n    bind_addr::Union{AbstractString, Nothing}\n    sshflags::Union{Cmd, Nothing}\n    max_parallel::Union{Integer, Nothing}\n\n    # Used by Local/SSH managers\n    connect_at::Any\n\n    [...]\nendMost of the fields in WorkerConfig are used by the inbuilt managers. Custom cluster managers would typically specify only io or host / port:If io is specified, it is used to read host/port information. A Julia worker prints out its bind address and port at startup. This allows Julia workers to listen on any free port available instead of requiring worker ports to be configured manually.\nIf io is not specified, host and port are used to connect.\ncount, exename and exeflags are relevant for launching additional workers from a worker. For example, a cluster manager may launch a single worker per node, and use that to launch additional workers.\ncount with an integer value n will launch a total of n workers.\ncount with a value of :auto will launch as many workers as the number of CPU threads (logical cores) on that machine.\nexename is the name of the julia executable including the full path.\nexeflags should be set to the required command line arguments for new workers.\ntunnel, bind_addr, sshflags and max_parallel are used when a ssh tunnel is required to connect to the workers from the master process.\nuserdata is provided for custom cluster managers to store their own worker-specific information.manage(manager::FooManager, id::Integer, config::WorkerConfig, op::Symbol) is called at different times during the worker\'s lifetime with appropriate op values:with :register/:deregister when a worker is added / removed from the Julia worker pool.\nwith :interrupt when interrupt(workers) is called. The ClusterManager should signal the appropriate worker with an interrupt signal.\nwith :finalize for cleanup purposes."

    "category": "section",
    "text": "Replacing the default TCP/IP all-to-all socket connections with a custom transport layer is a little more involved. Each Julia process has as many communication tasks as the workers it is connected to. For example, consider a Julia cluster of 32 processes in an all-to-all mesh network:Each Julia process thus has 31 communication tasks.\nEach task handles all incoming messages from a single remote worker in a message-processing loop.\nThe message-processing loop waits on an IO object (for example, a TCPSocket in the default implementation), reads an entire message, processes it and waits for the next one.\nSending messages to a process is done directly from any Julia task–not just communication tasks–again, via the appropriate IO object.Replacing the default transport requires the new implementation to set up connections to remote workers and to provide appropriate IO objects that the message-processing loops can wait on. The manager-specific callbacks to be implemented are:connect(manager::FooManager, pid::Integer, config::WorkerConfig)\nkill(manager::FooManager, pid::Int, config::WorkerConfig)The default implementation (which uses TCP/IP sockets) is implemented as connect(manager::ClusterManager, pid::Integer, config::WorkerConfig).connect should return a pair of IO objects, one for reading data sent from worker pid, and the other to write data that needs to be sent to worker pid. Custom cluster managers can use an in-memory BufferStream as the plumbing to proxy data between the custom, possibly non-IO transport and Julia\'s in-built parallel infrastructure.A BufferStream is an in-memory IOBuffer which behaves like an IO–it is a stream which can be handled asynchronously.The folder clustermanager/0mq in the Examples repository contains an example of using ZeroMQ to connect Julia workers in a star topology with a 0MQ broker in the middle. Note: The Julia processes are still all logically connected to each other–any worker can message any other worker directly without any awareness of 0MQ being used as the transport layer.When using custom transports:Julia workers must NOT be started with --worker. Starting with --worker will result in the newly launched workers defaulting to the TCP/IP socket transport implementation.\nFor every incoming logical connection with a worker, Base.process_messages(rd::IO, wr::IO)() must be called. This launches a new task that handles reading and writing of messages from/to the worker represented by the IO objects.\ninit_worker(cookie, manager::FooManager) must be called as part of worker process initialization.\nField connect_at::Any in WorkerConfig can be set by the cluster manager when launch is called. The value of this field is passed in in all connect callbacks. Typically, it carries information on how to connect to a worker. For example, the TCP/IP socket transport uses this field to specify the (host, port) tuple at which to connect to a worker.kill(manager, pid, config) is called to remove a worker from the cluster. On the master process, the corresponding IO objects must be closed by the implementation to ensure proper cleanup. The default implementation simply executes an exit() call on the specified remote worker.The Examples folder clustermanager/simple is an example that shows a simple implementation using UNIX domain sockets for cluster setup."

    "text": "Julia clusters are designed to be executed on already secured environments on infrastructure such as local laptops, departmental clusters, or even the cloud. This section covers network security requirements for the inbuilt LocalManager and SSHManager:The master process does not listen on any port. It only connects out to the workers.\nEach worker binds to only one of the local interfaces and listens on an ephemeral port number assigned by the OS.\nLocalManager, used by addprocs(N), by default binds only to the loopback interface. This means that workers started later on remote hosts (or by anyone with malicious intentions) are unable to connect to the cluster. An addprocs(4) followed by an addprocs([\"remote_host\"]) will fail. Some users may need to create a cluster comprising their local system and a few remote systems. This can be done by explicitly requesting LocalManager to bind to an external network interface via the restrict keyword argument: addprocs(4; restrict=false).\nSSHManager, used by addprocs(list_of_remote_hosts), launches workers on remote hosts via SSH. By default SSH is only used to launch Julia workers. Subsequent master-worker and worker-worker connections use plain, unencrypted TCP/IP sockets. The remote hosts must have passwordless login enabled. Additional SSH flags or credentials may be specified via keyword argument sshflags.\naddprocs(list_of_remote_hosts; tunnel=true, sshflags=<ssh keys and other flags>) is useful when we wish to use SSH connections for master-worker too. A typical scenario for this is a local laptop running the Julia REPL (i.e., the master) with the rest of the cluster on the cloud, say on Amazon EC2. In this case only port 22 needs to be opened at the remote cluster coupled with SSH client authenticated via public key infrastructure (PKI). Authentication credentials can be supplied via sshflags, for example sshflags=`-e <keyfile>`.\nIn an all-to-all topology (the default), all workers connect to each other via plain TCP sockets. The security policy on the cluster nodes must thus ensure free connectivity between workers for the ephemeral port range (varies by OS).\nSecuring and encrypting all worker-worker traffic (via SSH) or encrypting individual messages can be done via a custom ClusterManager."

If argument --worker is specified without the cookie, the worker tries to read the cookie from its standard input (stdin). The stdin is closed immediately after the cookie is retrieved.\nClusterManagers can retrieve the cookie on the master by calling cluster_cookie(). Cluster managers not using the default TCP/IP transport (and hence not specifying --worker) must call init_worker(cookie, manager) with the same cookie as on the master.Note that environments requiring higher levels of security can implement this via a custom ClusterManager.

You can use this object to connect the command to others via pipes, run it, and read or write to it.\nWhen the command is run, Julia does not capture its output unless you specifically arrange for it to. Instead, the output of the command by default goes to stdout as it would using libc\'s system call.\nThe command is never run with a shell. Instead, Julia parses the command syntax directly, appropriately interpolating variables and splitting on words as the shell would, respecting shell quoting syntax. The command is run as julia\'s immediate child process, using fork and exec calls.Here\'s a simple example of running an external program:julia> mycommand = `echo hello`\n`echo hello`\n\njulia> typeof(mycommand)\nCmd\n\njulia> run(mycommand);\nhelloThe hello is the output of the echo command, sent to stdout.

You can use $ for interpolation much as you would in a string literal (see Strings):julia> file = \"/etc/passwd\"\n\"/etc/passwd\"\n\njulia> `sort $file`\n`sort /etc/passwd`A common pitfall when running external programs via a shell is that if a file name contains characters that are special to the shell, they may cause undesirable behavior. Suppose, for example, rather than /etc/passwd, we wanted to sort the contents of the file /Volumes/External HD/data.csv. Let\'s try it:julia> file = \"/Volumes/External HD/data.csv\"\n\"/Volumes/External HD/data.csv\"\n\njulia> `sort $file`\n`sort \'/Volumes/External HD/data.csv\'`How did the file name get quoted? Julia knows that file is meant to be interpolated as a single argument, so it quotes the word for you. Actually, that is not quite accurate: the value of file is never interpreted by a shell, so there\'s no need for actual quoting; the quotes are inserted only for presentation to the user. This will even work if you interpolate a value as part of a shell word:julia> path = \"/Volumes/External HD\"\n\"/Volumes/External HD\"\n\njulia> name = \"data\"\n\"data\"\n\njulia> ext = \"csv\"\n\"csv\"\n\njulia> `sort $path/$name.$ext`\n`sort \'/Volumes/External HD/data.csv\'`As you can see, the space in the path variable is appropriately escaped. But what if you want to interpolate multiple words? In that case, just use an array (or any other iterable container):julia> files = [\"/etc/passwd\",\"/Volumes/External HD/data.csv\"]\n2-element Array{String,1}:\n \"/etc/passwd\"\n \"/Volumes/External HD/data.csv\"\n\njulia> `grep foo $files`\n`grep foo /etc/passwd \'/Volumes/External HD/data.csv\'`If you interpolate an array as part of a shell word, Julia emulates the shell\'s {a,b,c} argument generation:julia> names = [\"foo\",\"bar\",\"baz\"]\n3-element Array{String,1}:\n \"foo\"\n \"bar\"\n \"baz\"\n\njulia> `grep xylophone $names.txt`\n`grep xylophone foo.txt bar.txt baz.txt`Moreover, if you interpolate multiple arrays into the same word, the shell\'s Cartesian product generation behavior is emulated:julia> names = [\"foo\",\"bar\",\"baz\"]\n3-element Array{String,1}:\n \"foo\"\n \"bar\"\n \"baz\"\n\njulia> exts = [\"aux\",\"log\"]\n2-element Array{String,1}:\n \"aux\"\n \"log\"\n\njulia> `rm -f $names.$exts`\n`rm -f foo.aux foo.log bar.aux bar.log baz.aux baz.log`Since you can interpolate literal arrays, you can use this generative functionality without needing to create temporary array objects first:julia> `rm -rf $[\"foo\",\"bar\",\"baz\",\"qux\"].$[\"aux\",\"log\",\"pdf\"]`\n`rm -rf foo.aux foo.log foo.pdf bar.aux bar.log bar.pdf baz.aux baz.log baz.pdf qux.aux qux.log qux.pdf`"

Here\'s a simple example of a Perl one-liner at a shell prompt:sh$ perl -le \'$|=1; for (0..3) { print }\'\n0\n1\n2\n3The Perl expression needs to be in single quotes for two reasons: so that spaces don\'t break the expression into multiple shell words, and so that uses of Perl variables like $| (yes, that\'s the name of a variable in Perl), don\'t cause interpolation. In other instances, you may want to use double quotes so that interpolation does occur:sh$ first=\"A\"\nsh$ second=\"B\"\nsh$ perl -le \'$|=1; print for @ARGV\' \"1: $first\" \"2: $second\"\n1: A\n2: BIn general, the Julia backtick syntax is carefully designed so that you can just cut-and-paste shell commands as is into backticks and they will work: the escaping, quoting, and interpolation behaviors are the same as the shell\'s. The only difference is that the interpolation is integrated and aware of Julia\'s notion of what is a single string value, and what is a container for multiple values. Let\'s try the above two examples in Julia:julia> A = `perl -le \'$|=1; for (0..3) { print }\'`\n`perl -le \'$|=1; for (0..3) { print }\'`\n\njulia> run(A);\n0\n1\n2\n3\n\njulia> first = \"A\"; second = \"B\";\n\njulia> B = `perl -le \'print for @ARGV\' \"1: $first\" \"2: $second\"`\n`perl -le \'print for @ARGV\' \'1: A\' \'2: B\'`\n\njulia> run(B);\n1: A\n2: BThe results are identical, and Julia\'s interpolation behavior mimics the shell\'s with some improvements due to the fact that Julia supports first-class iterable objects while most shells use strings split on spaces for this, which introduces ambiguities. When trying to port shell commands to Julia, try cut and pasting first. Since Julia shows commands to you before running them, you can easily and safely just examine its interpretation without doing any damage."

The result is that a single line is printed: hello | sort. How, then, does one construct a pipeline? Instead of using \'|\' inside of backticks, one uses pipeline:julia> run(pipeline(`echo hello`, `sort`));\nhelloThis pipes the output of the echo command to the sort command.

Julia lets you pipe the output from both of these processes to another program:julia> run(pipeline(`echo world` & `echo hello`, `sort`));\nhello\nworldIn terms of UNIX plumbing, what\'s happening here is that a single UNIX pipe object is created and written to by both echo processes, and the other end of the pipe is read from by the sort command.IO redirection can be accomplished by passing keyword arguments stdin, stdout, and stderr to the pipeline function:pipeline(`do_work`, stdout=pipeline(`sort`, \"out.txt\"), stderr=\"errs.txt\")"

(Setting $|=1 in Perl causes each print statement to flush the stdout handle, which is necessary for this example to work.

    "text": "Though most code can be written in Julia, there are many high-quality, mature libraries for numerical computing already written in C and Fortran. To allow easy use of this existing code, Julia makes it simple and efficient to call C and Fortran functions. Julia has a \"no boilerplate\" philosophy: functions can be called directly from Julia without any \"glue\" code, code generation, or compilation – even from the interactive prompt. This is accomplished just by making an appropriate call with ccall syntax, which looks like an ordinary function call.The code to be called must be available as a shared library. Most C and Fortran libraries ship compiled as shared libraries already, but if you are compiling the code yourself using GCC (or Clang), you will need to use the -shared and -fPIC options. The machine instructions generated by Julia\'s JIT are the same as a native C call would be, so the resulting overhead is the same as calling a library function from C code. (Non-library function calls in both C and Julia can be inlined and thus may have even less overhead than calls to shared library functions. When both libraries and executables are generated by LLVM, it is possible to perform whole-program optimizations that can even optimize across this boundary, but Julia does not yet support that. In the future, however, it may do so, yielding even greater performance gains.)Shared libraries and functions are referenced by a tuple of the form (:function, \"library\") or (\"function\", \"library\") where function is the C-exported function name. library refers to the shared library name: shared libraries available in the (platform-specific) load path will be resolved by name, and if necessary a direct path may be specified.A function name may be used alone in place of the tuple (just :function or \"function\"). In this case the name is resolved within the current process. This form can be used to call C library functions, functions in the Julia runtime, or functions in an application linked to Julia.By default, Fortran compilers generate mangled names (for example, converting function names to lowercase or uppercase, often appending an underscore), and so to call a Fortran function via ccall you must pass the mangled identifier corresponding to the rule followed by your Fortran compiler.  Also, when calling a Fortran function, all inputs must be passed as pointers to allocated values on the heap or stack. This applies not only to arrays and other mutable objects which are normally heap-allocated, but also to scalar values such as integers and floats which are normally stack-allocated and commonly passed in registers when using C or Julia calling conventions.Finally, you can use ccall to actually generate a call to the library function. Arguments to ccall are as follows:A (:function, \"library\") pair, which must be written as a literal constant,\nOR\na function pointer (for example, from dlsym).\nReturn type (see below for mapping the declared C type to Julia)\nThis argument will be evaluated at compile-time, when the containing method is defined.\nA tuple of input types. The input types must be written as a literal tuple, not a tuple-valued variable or expression.\nThis argument will be evaluated at compile-time, when the containing method is defined.\nThe following arguments, if any, are the actual argument values passed to the function.As a complete but simple example, the following calls the clock function from the standard C library:julia> t = ccall((:clock, \"libc\"), Int32, ())\n2292761\n\njulia> t\n2292761\n\njulia> typeof(ans)\nInt32clock takes no arguments and returns an Int32. One common gotcha is that a 1-tuple must be written with a trailing comma. For example, to call the getenv function to get a pointer to the value of an environment variable, one makes a call like this:julia> path = ccall((:getenv, \"libc\"), Cstring, (Cstring,), \"SHELL\")\nCstring(@0x00007fff5fbffc45)\n\njulia> unsafe_string(path)\n\"/bin/bash\"Note that the argument type tuple must be written as (Cstring,), rather than (Cstring). This is because (Cstring) is just the expression Cstring surrounded by parentheses, rather than a 1-tuple containing Cstring:julia> (Cstring)\nCstring\n\njulia> (Cstring,)\n(Cstring,)In practice, especially when providing reusable functionality, one generally wraps ccall uses in Julia functions that set up arguments and then check for errors in whatever manner the C or Fortran function indicates them, propagating to the Julia caller as exceptions. This is especially important since C and Fortran APIs are notoriously inconsistent about how they indicate error conditions. For example, the getenv C library function is wrapped in the following Julia function, which is a simplified version of the actual definition from env.jl:function getenv(var::AbstractString)\n    val = ccall((:getenv, \"libc\"),\n                Cstring, (Cstring,), var)\n    if val == C_NULL\n        error(\"getenv: undefined variable: \", var)\n    end\n    unsafe_string(val)\nendThe C getenv function indicates an error by returning NULL, but other standard C functions indicate errors in various different ways, including by returning -1, 0, 1 and other special values. This wrapper throws an exception clearly indicating the problem if the caller tries to get a non-existent environment variable:julia> getenv(\"SHELL\")\n\"/bin/bash\"\n\njulia> getenv(\"FOOBAR\")\ngetenv: undefined variable: FOOBARHere is a slightly more complex example that discovers the local machine\'s hostname:function gethostname()\n    hostname = Vector{UInt8}(128)\n    ccall((:gethostname, \"libc\"), Int32,\n          (Ptr{UInt8}, Csize_t),\n          hostname, sizeof(hostname))\n    hostname[end] = 0; # ensure null-termination\n    return unsafe_string(pointer(hostname))\nendThis example first allocates an array of bytes, then calls the C library function gethostname to fill the array in with the hostname, takes a pointer to the hostname buffer, and converts the pointer to a Julia string, assuming that it is a NUL-terminated C string. It is common for C libraries to use this pattern of requiring the caller to allocate memory to be passed to the callee and filled in. Allocation of memory from Julia like this is generally accomplished by creating an uninitialized array and passing a pointer to its data to the C function. This is why we don\'t use the Cstring type here: as the array is uninitialized, it could contain NUL bytes. Converting to a Cstring as part of the ccall checks for contained NUL bytes and could therefore throw a conversion error."

For example, to match C prototypes of the form:typedef returntype (*functiontype)(argumenttype, ...)The macro @cfunction generates the C-compatible function pointer for a call to a Julia function. Arguments to @cfunction are as follows:A Julia Function\nReturn type\nA literal tuple of input typesLike ccall, all of these arguments will be evaluated at compile-time, when the containing method is defined.Currently, only the platform-default C calling convention is supported. This means that @cfunction-generated pointers cannot be used in calls where WINAPI expects stdcall function on 32-bit windows, but can be used on WIN64 (where stdcall is unified with the C calling convention).A classic example is the standard C library qsort function, declared as:void qsort(void *base, size_t nmemb, size_t size,\n           int (*compare)(const void*, const void*));The base argument is a pointer to an array of length nmemb, with elements of size bytes each. compare is a callback function which takes pointers to two elements a and b and returns an integer less/greater than zero if a should appear before/after b (or zero if any order is permitted). Now, suppose that we have a 1d array A of values in Julia that we want to sort using the qsort function (rather than Julia\'s built-in sort function). Before we worry about calling qsort and passing arguments, we need to write a comparison function that works for some arbitrary objects (which define <):julia> function mycompare(a, b)::Cint\n           return (a < b) ? -1 : ((a > b) ? +1 : 0)\n       end\nmycompare (generic function with 1 method)Notice that we have to be careful about the return type: qsort expects a function returning a C int, so we annotate the return type of the function to be sure it returns a Cint.In order to pass this function to C, we obtain its address using the macro @cfunction:julia> mycompare_c = @cfunction(mycompare, Cint, (Ref{Cdouble}, Ref{Cdouble}));@cfunction requires three arguments: the Julia function (mycompare), the return type (Cint), and a literal tuple of the input argument types, in this case to sort an array of Cdouble (Float64) elements.The final call to qsort looks like this:julia> A = [1.3, -2.7, 4.4, 3.1]\n4-element Array{Float64,1}:\n  1.3\n -2.7\n  4.4\n  3.1\n\njulia> ccall(:qsort, Cvoid, (Ptr{Cdouble}, Csize_t, Csize_t, Ptr{Cvoid}),\n             A, length(A), sizeof(eltype(A)), mycompare_c)\n\njulia> A\n4-element Array{Float64,1}:\n -2.7\n  1.3\n  3.1\n  4.4As can be seen, A is changed to the sorted array [-2.7, 1.3, 3.1, 4.4]. Note that Julia knows how to convert an array into a Ptr{Cdouble}, how to compute the size of a type in bytes (identical to C\'s sizeof operator), and so on. For fun, try inserting a println(\"mycompare($a, $b)\") line into mycompare, which will allow you to see the comparisons that qsort is performing (and to verify that it is really calling the Julia function that you passed to it)."

    "text": "There are several special types to be aware of, as no other type can be defined to behave the same:Float32\nExactly corresponds to the float type in C (or REAL*4 in Fortran).\nFloat64\nExactly corresponds to the double type in C (or REAL*8 in Fortran).\nComplexF32\nExactly corresponds to the complex float type in C (or COMPLEX*8 in Fortran).\nComplexF64\nExactly corresponds to the complex double type in C (or COMPLEX*16 in Fortran).\nSigned\nExactly corresponds to the signed type annotation in C (or any INTEGER type in Fortran). Any Julia type that is not a subtype of Signed is assumed to be unsigned.Ref{T}\nBehaves like a Ptr{T} that can manage its memory via the Julia GC.Array{T,N}\nWhen an array is passed to C as a Ptr{T} argument, it is not reinterpret-cast: Julia requires that the element type of the array matches T, and the address of the first element is passed.\nTherefore, if an Array contains data in the wrong format, it will have to be explicitly converted using a call such as trunc(Int32, a).\nTo pass an array A as a pointer of a different type without converting the data beforehand (for example, to pass a Float64 array to a function that operates on uninterpreted bytes), you can declare the argument as Ptr{Cvoid}.\nIf an array of eltype Ptr{T} is passed as a Ptr{Ptr{T}} argument, Base.cconvert will attempt to first make a null-terminated copy of the array with each element replaced by its Base.cconvert version. This allows, for example, passing an argv pointer array of type Vector{String} to an argument of type Ptr{Ptr{Cchar}}.On all systems we currently support, basic C/C++ value types may be translated to Julia types as follows. Every C type also has a corresponding Julia type with the same name, prefixed by C. This can help for writing portable code (and remembering that an int in C is not the same as an Int in Julia).System Independent:C name Fortran name Standard Julia Alias Julia Base Type\nunsigned char CHARACTER Cuchar UInt8\nbool (only in C++)  Cuchar UInt8\nshort INTEGER*2, LOGICAL*2 Cshort Int16\nunsigned short  Cushort UInt16\nint, BOOL (C, typical) INTEGER*4, LOGICAL*4 Cint Int32\nunsigned int  Cuint UInt32\nlong long INTEGER*8, LOGICAL*8 Clonglong Int64\nunsigned long long  Culonglong UInt64\nintmax_t  Cintmax_t Int64\nuintmax_t  Cuintmax_t UInt64\nfloat REAL*4i Cfloat Float32\ndouble REAL*8 Cdouble Float64\ncomplex float COMPLEX*8 ComplexF32 Complex{Float32}\ncomplex double COMPLEX*16 ComplexF64 Complex{Float64}\nptrdiff_t  Cptrdiff_t Int\nssize_t  Cssize_t Int\nsize_t  Csize_t UInt\nvoid   Cvoid\nvoid and [[noreturn]] or _Noreturn   Union{}\nvoid*   Ptr{Cvoid}\nT* (where T represents an appropriately defined type)   Ref{T}\nchar* (or char[], e.g. a string) CHARACTER*N  Cstring if NUL-terminated, or Ptr{UInt8} if not\nchar** (or *char[])   Ptr{Ptr{UInt8}}\njl_value_t* (any Julia Type)   Any\njl_value_t** (a reference to a Julia Type)   Ref{Any}\nva_arg   Not supported\n... (variadic function specification)   T... (where T is one of the above types, variadic functions of different argument types are not supported)The Cstring type is essentially a synonym for Ptr{UInt8}, except the conversion to Cstring throws an error if the Julia string contains any embedded NUL characters (which would cause the string to be silently truncated if the C routine treats NUL as the terminator).  If you are passing a char* to a C routine that does not assume NUL termination (e.g. because you pass an explicit string length), or if you know for certain that your Julia string does not contain NUL and want to skip the check, you can use Ptr{UInt8} as the argument type. Cstring can also be used as the ccall return type, but in that case it obviously does not introduce any extra checks and is only meant to improve readability of the call.System-dependent:C name Standard Julia Alias Julia Base Type\nchar Cchar Int8 (x86, x86_64), UInt8 (powerpc, arm)\nlong Clong Int (UNIX), Int32 (Windows)\nunsigned long Culong UInt (UNIX), UInt32 (Windows)\nwchar_t Cwchar_t Int32 (UNIX), UInt16 (Windows)note: Note\nWhen calling Fortran, all inputs must be passed by pointers to heap- or stack-allocated values, so all type correspondences above should contain an additional Ptr{..} or Ref{..} wrapper around their type specification.warning: Warning\nFor string arguments (char*) the Julia type should be Cstring (if NUL- terminated data is expected) or either Ptr{Cchar} or Ptr{UInt8} otherwise (these two pointer types have the same effect), as described above, not String. Similarly, for array arguments (T[] or T*), the Julia type should again be Ptr{T}, not Vector{T}.warning: Warning\nJulia\'s Char type is 32 bits, which is not the same as the wide character type (wchar_t or wint_t) on all platforms.warning: Warning\nA return type of Union{} means the function will not return i.e. C++11 [[noreturn]] or C11 _Noreturn (e.g. jl_throw or longjmp). Do not use this for functions that return no value (void) but do return, use Cvoid instead.note: Note\nFor wchar_t* arguments, the Julia type should be Cwstring (if the C routine expects a NUL-terminated string) or Ptr{Cwchar_t} otherwise. Note also that UTF-8 string data in Julia is internally NUL-terminated, so it can be passed to C functions expecting NUL-terminated data without making a copy (but using the Cwstring type will cause an error to be thrown if the string itself contains NUL characters).note: Note\nC functions that take an argument of the type char** can be called by using a Ptr{Ptr{UInt8}} type within Julia. For example, C functions of the form:int main(int argc, char **argv);can be called via the following Julia code:argv = [ \"a.out\", \"arg1\", \"arg2\" ]\nccall(:main, Int32, (Int32, Ptr{Ptr{UInt8}}), length(argv), argv)note: Note\nFor Fortran functions taking variable length strings of type character(len=*) the string lengths are provided as hidden arguments. Type and position of these arguments in the list are compiler specific, where compiler vendors usually default to using Csize_t as type and append the hidden arguments at the end of the argument list. While this behaviour is fixed for some compilers (GNU), others optionally permit placing hidden arguments directly after the character argument (Intel,PGI). For example, Fortran subroutines of the formsubroutine test(str1, str2)\ncharacter(len=*) :: str1,str2can be called via the following Julia code, where the lengths are appendedstr1 = \"foo\"\nstr2 = \"bar\"\nccall(:test, Void, (Ptr{UInt8}, Ptr{UInt8}, Csize_t, Csize_t),\n                    str1, str2, sizeof(str1), sizeof(str2))warning: Warning\nFortran compilers may also add other hidden arguments for pointers, assumed-shape (:) and assumed-size (*) arrays. Such behaviour can be avoided by using ISO_C_BINDING and including bind(c) in the definition of the subroutine, which is strongly recommended for interoperable code. In this case there will be no hidden arguments, at the cost of some language features (e.g. only character(len=1) will be permitted to pass strings).note: Note\nA C function declared to return Cvoid will return the value nothing in Julia."

All other types are stored as a pointer to the data. When mirroring a struct used by-value inside another struct in C, it is imperative that you do not attempt to manually copy the fields over, as this will not preserve the correct field alignment. Instead, declare an isbits struct type and use that instead. Unnamed structs are not possible in the translation to Julia.Packed structs and union declarations are not supported by Julia.You can get a near approximation of a union if you know, a priori, the field that will have the greatest size (potentially including padding). When translating your fields to Julia, declare the Julia field to be only of that type.Arrays of parameters can be expressed with NTuple:in C:\nstruct B {\n    int A[3];\n};\nb_a_2 = B.A[2];\n\nin Julia:\nstruct B\n    A::NTuple{3, CInt}\nend\nb_a_2 = B.A[3]  # note the difference in indexing (1-based in Julia, 0-based in C)Arrays of unknown size (C99-compliant variable length structs specified by [] or [0]) are not directly supported. Often the best way to deal with these is to deal with the byte offsets directly. For example, if a C library declared a proper string type and returned a pointer to it:struct String {\n    int strlen;\n    char data[];\n};In Julia, we can access the parts independently to make a copy of that string:str = from_c::Ptr{Cvoid}\nlen = unsafe_load(Ptr{Cint}(str))\nunsafe_string(str + Core.sizeof(Cint), len)"

The static parameters of the function may be used as type parameters in the call signature, as long as they don\'t affect the layout of the type. For example, f(x::T) where {T} = ccall(:valid, Ptr{T}, (Ptr{T},), x) is valid, since Ptr is always a word-size primitive type.

    "text": "Here is a simple example of a C wrapper that returns a Ptr type:mutable struct gsl_permutation\nend\n\n# The corresponding C signature is\n#     gsl_permutation * gsl_permutation_alloc (size_t n);\nfunction permutation_alloc(n::Integer)\n    output_ptr = ccall(\n        (:gsl_permutation_alloc, :libgsl), # name of C function and library\n        Ptr{gsl_permutation},              # output type\n        (Csize_t,),                        # tuple of input types\n        n                                  # name of Julia variable to pass in\n    )\n    if output_ptr == C_NULL # Could not allocate memory\n        throw(OutOfMemoryError())\n    end\n    return output_ptr\nendThe GNU Scientific Library (here assumed to be accessible through :libgsl) defines an opaque pointer, gsl_permutation *, as the return type of the C function gsl_permutation_alloc. As user code never has to look inside the gsl_permutation struct, the corresponding Julia wrapper simply needs a new type declaration, gsl_permutation, that has no internal fields and whose sole purpose is to be placed in the type parameter of a Ptr type.  The return type of the ccall is declared as Ptr{gsl_permutation}, since the memory allocated and pointed to by output_ptr is controlled by C (and not Julia).The input n is passed by value, and so the function\'s input signature is simply declared as (Csize_t,) without any Ref or Ptr necessary. (If the wrapper was calling a Fortran function instead, the corresponding function input signature should instead be (Ref{Csize_t},), since Fortran variables are passed by pointers.) Furthermore, n can be any type that is convertible to a Csize_t integer; the ccall implicitly calls Base.cconvert(Csize_t, n).Here is a second example wrapping the corresponding destructor:# The corresponding C signature is\n#     void gsl_permutation_free (gsl_permutation * p);\nfunction permutation_free(p::Ref{gsl_permutation})\n    ccall(\n        (:gsl_permutation_free, :libgsl), # name of C function and library\n        Cvoid,                             # output type\n        (Ref{gsl_permutation},),          # tuple of input types\n        p                                 # name of Julia variable to pass in\n    )\nendHere, the input p is declared to be of type Ref{gsl_permutation}, meaning that the memory that p points to may be managed by Julia or by C. A pointer to memory allocated by C should be of type Ptr{gsl_permutation}, but it is convertible using Base.cconvert and therefore can be used in the same (covariant) context of the input argument to a ccall. A pointer to memory allocated by Julia must be of type Ref{gsl_permutation}, to ensure that the memory address pointed to is valid and that Julia\'s garbage collector manages the chunk of memory pointed to correctly. Therefore, the Ref{gsl_permutation} declaration allows pointers managed by C or Julia to be used.If the C wrapper never expects the user to pass pointers to memory managed by Julia, then using p::Ptr{gsl_permutation} for the method signature of the wrapper and similarly in the ccall is also acceptable.Here is a third example passing Julia arrays:# The corresponding C signature is\n#    int gsl_sf_bessel_Jn_array (int nmin, int nmax, double x,\n#                                double result_array[])\nfunction sf_bessel_Jn_array(nmin::Integer, nmax::Integer, x::Real)\n    if nmax < nmin\n        throw(DomainError())\n    end\n    result_array = Vector{Cdouble}(nmax - nmin + 1)\n    errorcode = ccall(\n        (:gsl_sf_bessel_Jn_array, :libgsl), # name of C function and library\n        Cint,                               # output type\n        (Cint, Cint, Cdouble, Ref{Cdouble}),# tuple of input types\n        nmin, nmax, x, result_array         # names of Julia variables to pass in\n    )\n    if errorcode != 0\n        error(\"GSL error code $errorcode\")\n    end\n    return result_array\nendThe C function wrapped returns an integer error code; the results of the actual evaluation of the Bessel J function populate the Julia array result_array. This variable can only be used with corresponding input type declaration Ref{Cdouble}, since its memory is allocated and managed by Julia, not C. The implicit call to Base.cconvert(Ref{Cdouble}, result_array) unpacks the Julia pointer to a Julia array data structure into a form understandable by C.Note that for this code to work correctly, result_array must be declared to be of type Ref{Cdouble} and not Ptr{Cdouble}. The memory is managed by Julia and the Ref signature alerts Julia\'s garbage collector to keep managing the memory for result_array while the ccall executes. If Ptr{Cdouble} were used instead, the ccall may still work, but Julia\'s garbage collector would not be aware that the memory declared for result_array is being used by the external C function. As a result, the code may produce a memory leak if result_array never gets freed by the garbage collector, or if the garbage collector prematurely frees result_array, the C function may end up throwing an invalid memory access exception."

    "category": "section",
    "text": "When passing data to a ccall, it is best to avoid using the pointer function. Instead define a convert method and pass the variables directly to the ccall. ccall automatically arranges that all of its arguments will be preserved from garbage collection until the call returns. If a C API will store a reference to memory allocated by Julia, after the ccall returns, you must arrange that the object remains visible to the garbage collector. The suggested way to handle this is to make a global variable of type Array{Ref,1} to hold these values, until the C library notifies you that it is finished with them.Whenever you have created a pointer to Julia data, you must ensure the original data exists until you are done with using the pointer. Many methods in Julia such as unsafe_load and String make copies of data instead of taking ownership of the buffer, so that it is safe to free (or alter) the original data without affecting Julia. A notable exception is unsafe_wrap which, for performance reasons, shares (or can be told to take ownership of) the underlying buffer.The garbage collector does not guarantee any order of finalization. That is, if a contained a reference to b and both a and b are due for garbage collection, there is no guarantee that b would be finalized after a. If proper finalization of a depends on b being valid, it must be handled in other ways."

    "text": "A (name, library) function specification must be a constant expression. However, it is possible to use computed values as function names by staging through eval as follows:@eval ccall(($(string(\"a\", \"b\")), \"lib\"), ...This expression constructs a name using string, then substitutes this name into a new ccall expression, which is then evaluated. Keep in mind that eval only operates at the top level, so within this expression local variables will not be available (unless their values are substituted with $). For this reason, eval is typically only used to form top-level definitions, for example when wrapping libraries that contain many similar functions. A similar example can be constructed for @cfunction.However, doing this will also be very slow and leak memory, so you should usually avoid this and instead keep reading. The next section discusses how to use indirect calls to efficiently accomplish a similar effect."

For example (from base/libc.jl) we see the same gethostnameccall as above, but with the correct signature for Windows:hn = Vector{UInt8}(256)\nerr = ccall(:gethostname, stdcall, Int32, (Ptr{UInt8}, UInt32), hn, length(hn))For more information, please see the LLVM Language Reference.There is one additional special calling convention llvmcall, which allows inserting calls to LLVM intrinsics directly. This can be especially useful when targeting unusual platforms such as GPGPUs. For example, for CUDA, we need to be able to read the thread index:ccall(\"llvm.nvvm.read.ptx.sreg.tid.x\", llvmcall, Int32, ())As with any ccall, it is essential to get the argument signature exactly correct.

    "category": "section",
    "text": "The following methods are described as \"unsafe\" because a bad pointer or type declaration can cause Julia to terminate abruptly.Given a Ptr{T}, the contents of type T can generally be copied from the referenced memory into a Julia object using unsafe_load(ptr, [index]). The index argument is optional (default is 1), and follows the Julia-convention of 1-based indexing. This function is intentionally similar to the behavior of getindex and setindex! (e.g. [] access syntax).The return value will be a new object initialized to contain a copy of the contents of the referenced memory. The referenced memory can safely be freed or released.If T is Any, then the memory is assumed to contain a reference to a Julia object (a jl_value_t*), the result will be a reference to this object, and the object will not be copied. You must be careful in this case to ensure that the object was always visible to the garbage collector (pointers do not count, but the new reference does) to ensure the memory is not prematurely freed. Note that if the object was not originally allocated by Julia, the new object will never be finalized by Julia\'s garbage collector.  If the Ptr itself is actually a jl_value_t*, it can be converted back to a Julia object reference by unsafe_pointer_to_objref(ptr). (Julia values v can be converted to jl_value_t* pointers, as Ptr{Cvoid}, by calling pointer_from_objref(v).)The reverse operation (writing data to a Ptr{T}), can be performed using unsafe_store!(ptr, value, [index]). Currently, this is only supported for primitive types or other pointer-free (isbits) immutable struct types.Any operation that throws an error is probably currently unimplemented and should be posted as a bug so that it can be resolved.If the pointer of interest is a plain-data array (primitive type or immutable struct), the function unsafe_wrap(Array, ptr,dims, own = false) may be more useful. The final parameter should be true if Julia should \"take ownership\" of the underlying buffer and call free(ptr) when the returned Array object is finalized.  If the own parameter is omitted or false, the caller must ensure the buffer remains in existence until all access is complete.Arithmetic on the Ptr type in Julia (e.g. using +) does not behave the same as C\'s pointer arithmetic. Adding an integer to a Ptr in Julia always moves the pointer by some number of bytes, not elements. This way, the address values obtained from pointer arithmetic do not depend on the element types of pointers."

To do this, create an AsyncCondition object and wait on it:cond = Base.AsyncCondition()\nwait(cond)The callback you pass to C should only execute a ccall to :uv_async_send, passing cond.handle as the argument, taking care to avoid any allocations or other interactions with the Julia runtime.Note that events may be coalesced, so multiple calls to uv_async_send may result in a single wakeup notification to the condition."

But there are situations where the opposite is needed: calling Julia function from C code. This can be used to integrate Julia code into a larger C/C++ project, without the need to rewrite everything in C/C++. Julia has a C API to make this possible. As almost all programming languages have some way to call C functions, the Julia C API can also be used to build further language bridges (e.g. calling Julia from Python or C#)."

For instance, when Julia is installed to $JULIA_DIR, one can compile the above test program test.c with gcc using:gcc -o test -fPIC -I$JULIA_DIR/include/julia -L$JULIA_DIR/lib test.c -ljulia $JULIA_DIR/lib/julia/libstdc++.so.6Then if the environment variable JULIA_BINDIR is set to $JULIA_DIR/bin, the output test program can be executed.Alternatively, look at the embedding.c program in the Julia source tree in the test/embedding/ folder. The file ui/repl.c program is another simple example of how to set jl_options options while linking against libjulia.The first thing that has to be done before calling any other Julia C function is to initialize Julia. This is done by calling jl_init, which tries to automatically determine Julia\'s install location. If you need to specify a custom location, or specify which system image to load, use jl_init_with_image instead.The second statement in the test program evaluates a Julia statement using a call to jl_eval_string.Before the program terminates, it is strongly recommended to call jl_atexit_hook.  The above example program calls this before returning from main.note: Note\nCurrently, dynamically linking with the libjulia shared library requires passing the RTLD_GLOBAL option. In Python, this looks like:>>> julia=CDLL(\'./libjulia.dylib\',RTLD_GLOBAL)\n>>> julia.jl_init.argtypes = []\n>>> julia.jl_init()\n250593296note: Note\nIf the julia program needs to access symbols from the main executable, it may be necessary to add -Wl,--export-dynamic linker flag at compile time on Linux in addition to the ones generated by julia-config.jl described below.

Storing simple data types like Float64 in this way is called boxing, and extracting the stored primitive data is called unboxing. Our improved sample program that calculates the square root of 2 in Julia and reads back the result in C looks as follows:jl_value_t *ret = jl_eval_string(\"sqrt(2.0)\");\n\nif (jl_typeis(ret, jl_float64_type)) {\n    double ret_unboxed = jl_unbox_float64(ret);\n    printf(\"sqrt(2.0) in C: %e \\n\", ret_unboxed);\n}\nelse {\n    printf(\"ERROR: unexpected return type from sqrt(::Float64)\\n\");\n}In order to check whether ret is of a specific Julia type, we can use the jl_isa, jl_typeis, or jl_is_... functions. By typing typeof(sqrt(2.0)) into the Julia shell we can see that the return type is Float64 (double in C). To convert the boxed Julia value into a C double the jl_unbox_float64 function is used in the above code snippet.Corresponding jl_box_... functions are used to convert the other way:jl_value_t *a = jl_box_float64(3.0);\njl_value_t *b = jl_box_float32(3.0f);\njl_value_t *c = jl_box_int32(3);As we will see next, boxing is required to call Julia functions with specific arguments."

    "text": "As we have seen, Julia objects are represented in C as pointers. This raises the question of who is responsible for freeing these objects.Typically, Julia objects are freed by a garbage collector (GC), but the GC does not automatically know that we are holding a reference to a Julia value from C. This means the GC can free objects out from under you, rendering pointers invalid.The GC can only run when Julia objects are allocated. Calls like jl_box_float64 perform allocation, and allocation might also happen at any point in running Julia code. However, it is generally safe to use pointers in between jl_... calls. But in order to make sure that values can survive jl_... calls, we have to tell Julia that we hold a reference to a Julia value. This can be done using the JL_GC_PUSH macros:jl_value_t *ret = jl_eval_string(\"sqrt(2.0)\");\nJL_GC_PUSH1(&ret);\n// Do something with ret\nJL_GC_POP();The JL_GC_POP call releases the references established by the previous JL_GC_PUSH. Note that JL_GC_PUSH  is working on the stack, so it must be exactly paired with a JL_GC_POP before the stack frame is destroyed.Several Julia values can be pushed at once using the JL_GC_PUSH2 , JL_GC_PUSH3 , and JL_GC_PUSH4 macros. To push an array of Julia values one can use the  JL_GC_PUSHARGS macro, which can be used as follows:jl_value_t **args;\nJL_GC_PUSHARGS(args, 2); // args can now hold 2 `jl_value_t*` objects\nargs[0] = some_value;\nargs[1] = some_other_value;\n// Do something with args (e.g. call jl_... functions)\nJL_GC_POP();The garbage collector also operates under the assumption that it is aware of every old-generation object pointing to a young-generation one. Any time a pointer is updated breaking that assumption, it must be signaled to the collector with the jl_gc_wb (write barrier) function like so:jl_value_t *parent = some_old_value, *child = some_young_value;\n((some_specific_type*)parent)->field = child;\njl_gc_wb(parent, child);It is in general impossible to predict which values will be old at runtime, so the write barrier must be inserted after all explicit stores. One notable exception is if the parent object was just allocated and garbage collection was not run since then. Remember that most jl_... functions can sometimes invoke garbage collection.The write barrier is also necessary for arrays of pointers when updating their data directly. For example:jl_array_t *some_array = ...; // e.g. a Vector{Any}\nvoid **data = (void**)jl_array_data(some_array);\njl_value_t *some_value = ...;\ndata[0] = some_value;\njl_gc_wb(some_array, some_value);"

    "text": "Julia has two mechanisms for loading code:Code inclusion: e.g. include(\"source.jl\"). Inclusion allows you to split a single program across multiple source files. The expression include(\"source.jl\") causes the contents of the file source.jl to be evaluated in the global scope of the module where the include call occurs. If include(\"source.jl\") is called multiple times, source.jl is evaluated multiple times. The included path, source.jl, is interpreted relative to the file where the include call occurs. This makes it simple to relocate a subtree of source files. In the REPL, included paths are interpreted relative to the current working directory, pwd().\nPackage loading: e.g. import X or using X. The import mechanism allows you to load a package—i.e. an independent, reusable collection of Julia code, wrapped in a module—and makes the resulting module available by the name X inside of the importing module. If the same X package is imported multiple times in the same Julia session, it is only loaded the first time—on subsequent imports, the importing module gets a reference to the same module. It should be noted, however, that import X can load different packages in different contexts: X can refer to one package named X in the main project but potentially different packages named X in each dependency. More on this below.Code inclusion is quite straightforward: it simply parses and evaluates a source file in the context of the caller. Package loading is built on top of code inclusion and is quite a bit more complex. The rest of this chapter, therefore, focuses on the behavior and mechanics of package loading.note: Note\nYou only need to read this chapter if you want to understand the technical details of package loading in Julia. If you just want to install and use packages, simply use Julia\'s built-in package manager to add packages to your environment and write import X or using X in your code to load packages that you\'ve added.A package is a source tree with a standard layout providing functionality that can be reused by other Julia projects. A package is loaded by import X or  using X statements. These statements also make the module named X, which results from loading the package code, available within the module where the import statement occurs. The meaning of X in import X is context-dependent: which X package is loaded depends on what code the statement occurs in. The effect of import X depends on two questions:What package is X in this context?\nWhere can that X package be found?Understanding how Julia answers these questions is key to understanding package loading."

    "text": "Julia supports federated management of packages. This means that multiple independent parties can maintain both public and private packages and registries of them, and that projects can depend on a mix of public and private packages from different registries. Packages from various registries are installed and managed using a common set of tools and workflows. The Pkg package manager ships with Julia 0.7/1.0 and lets you install and manage dependencies of your projects, by creating and manipulating project files, which describe what your project depends on, and manifest files that snapshot exact versions of your project\'s complete dependency graph.One consequence of federation is that there cannot be a central authority for package naming. Different entities may use the same name to refer to unrelated packages. This possibility is unavoidable since these entities do not coordinate and may not even know about each other. Because of the lack of a central naming authority, a single project can quite possibly end up depending on different packages with the same name. Julia\'s package loading mechanism handles this by not requiring package names to be globally unique, even within the dependency graph of a single project. Instead, packages are identified by universally unique identifiers (UUIDs) which are assigned to them before they are registered. The question \"what is X?\" is answered by determining the UUID of X.Since the decentralized naming problem is somewhat abstract, it may help to walk through a concrete scenario to understand the issue. Suppose you\'re developing an application called App, which uses two packages: Pub and  Priv. Priv is a private package that you created, whereas Pub is a public package that you use but don\'t control. When you created Priv, there was no public package by that name. Subsequently, however, an unrelated package also named Priv has been published and become popular. In fact, the Pub package has started to use it. Therefore, when you next upgrade Pub to get the latest bug fixes and features, App will end up—through no action of yours other than upgrading—depending on two different packages named Priv. App has a direct dependency on your private Priv package, and an indirect dependency, through Pub, on the new public Priv package. Since these two Priv packages are different but both required for App to continue working correctly, the expression import Priv must refer to different Priv packages depending on whether it occurs in App\'s code or in Pub\'s code. Julia\'s package loading mechanism allows this by distinguishing the two Priv packages by context and UUID. How this distinction works is determined by environments, as explained in the following sections."

    "category": "section",
    "text": "An environment determines what import X and using X mean in various code contexts and what files these statements cause to be loaded. Julia understands three kinds of environments:A project environment is a directory with a project file and an optional manifest file. The project file determines what the names and identities of the direct dependencies of a project are. The manifest file, if present, gives a complete dependency graph, including all direct and indirect dependencies, exact versions of each dependency, and sufficient information to locate and load the correct version.\nA package directory is a directory containing the source trees of a set of packages as subdirectories. This kind of environment was the only kind that existed in Julia 0.6 and earlier. If X is a subdirectory of a package directory and X/src/X.jl exists, then the package X is available in the package directory environment and X/src/X.jl is the source file by which it is loaded.\nA stacked environment is an ordered set of project environments and package directories, overlaid to make a single composite environment in which all the packages available in its constituent environments are available. Julia\'s load path is a stacked environment, for example.These three kinds of environment each serve a different purpose:Project environments provide reproducibility. By checking a project environment into version control—e.g. a git repository—along with the rest of the project\'s source code, you can reproduce the exact state of the project and all of its dependencies since the manifest file captures the exact version of every dependency and can be rematerialized easily.\nPackage directories provide low-overhead convenience when a project environment would be overkill: are handy when you have a set of packages and just want to put them somewhere and use them as they are without having to create and maintain a project environment for them.\nStacked environments allow for augmentation of the primary environment with additional tools. You can push an environment including development tools onto the stack and they will be available from the REPL and scripts but not from inside of packages.As an abstraction, an environment provides three maps: roots, graph and paths. When resolving the meaning of import X, roots and graph are used to determine the identity of X and answer the question \"what is X?\", while the paths map is used to locate the source code of X and answer the question \"where is X?\" The specific roles of the three maps are:roots: name::Symbol ⟶ uuid::UUID\nAn environment\'s roots map assigns package names to UUIDs for all the top-level dependencies that the environment makes available to the main project (i.e. the ones that can be loaded in Main). When Julia encounters import X in the main project, it looks up the identity of X as roots[:X].\ngraph: context::UUID ⟶ name::Symbol ⟶ uuid::UUID\nAn environment\'s graph is a multilevel map which assigns, for each context UUID, a map from names to UUIDs, similar to the roots map but specific to that context. When Julia sees import X in the code of the package whose UUID is context, it looks up the identity of X as graph[context][:X]. In particular, this means that import X can refer to different packages depending on context.\npaths: uuid::UUID × name::Symbol ⟶ path::String\nThe paths map assigns to each package UUID-name pair, the location of the entry-point source file of that package. After the identity of X in import X has been resolved to a UUID via roots or graph (depending on whether it is loaded from the main project or an dependency), Julia determines what file to load to acquire X by looking up paths[uuid,:X] in the environment. Including this file should create a module named X. After the first time this package is loaded, any import resolving to the same uuid will simply create a new binding to the same already-loaded package module.Each kind of environment defines these three maps differently, as detailed in the following sections.note: Note\nFor clarity of exposition, the examples throughout this chapter include fully materialized data structures for roots, graph and paths. However, these maps are really only abstractions—for efficiency, Julia\'s package loading code does not actually materialize them. Instead, it queries them through internal APIs and lazily computes only as much of each structure as is necessary to load a given package."

Consider the following example project file for the hypothetical application, App, as described above:name = \"App\"\nuuid = \"8f986787-14fe-4607-ba5d-fbff2944afa9\"\n\n[deps]\nPriv = \"ba13f791-ae1d-465a-978b-69c3ad90f72b\"\nPub  = \"c07ecb7d-0dc9-4db7-8803-fadaaeaf08e1\"This project file implies the following roots map, if it were materialized as a Julia dictionary:roots = Dict(\n    :App  => UUID(\"8f986787-14fe-4607-ba5d-fbff2944afa9\"),\n    :Priv => UUID(\"ba13f791-ae1d-465a-978b-69c3ad90f72b\"),\n    :Pub  => UUID(\"c07ecb7d-0dc9-4db7-8803-fadaaeaf08e1\"),\n)Given this roots map, in the code of App the statement import Priv will cause Julia to look up roots[:Priv], which yields ba13f791-ae1d-465a-978b-69c3ad90f72b, the UUID of the Priv package that is to be loaded in that context. This UUID identifies which Priv package to load and use when the main application evaluates import Priv.The dependency graph of a project environment is determined by the contents of the manifest file, if present, or if there is no manifest file, graph is empty. A manifest file contains a stanza for each direct or indirect dependency of a project, including for each one, its UUID and a source tree hash or an explicit path to the source code. Consider the following example manifest file for App:[[Priv]] # the private one\ndeps = [\"Pub\", \"Zebra\"]\nuuid = \"ba13f791-ae1d-465a-978b-69c3ad90f72b\"\npath = \"deps/Priv\"\n\n[[Priv]] # the public one\nuuid = \"2d15fe94-a1f7-436c-a4d8-07a9a496e01c\"\ngit-tree-sha1 = \"1bf63d3be994fe83456a03b874b409cfd59a6373\"\nversion = \"0.1.5\"\n\n[[Pub]]\nuuid = \"c07ecb7d-0dc9-4db7-8803-fadaaeaf08e1\"\ngit-tree-sha1 = \"9ebd50e2b0dd1e110e842df3b433cb5869b0dd38\"\nversion = \"2.1.4\"\n\n  [Pub.deps]\n  Priv = \"2d15fe94-a1f7-436c-a4d8-07a9a496e01c\"\n  Zebra = \"f7a24cb4-21fc-4002-ac70-f0e3a0dd3f62\"\n\n[[Zebra]]\nuuid = \"f7a24cb4-21fc-4002-ac70-f0e3a0dd3f62\"\ngit-tree-sha1 = \"e808e36a5d7173974b90a15a353b564f3494092f\"\nversion = \"3.4.2\"This manifest file describes a possible complete dependency graph for the App project:There are two different Priv packages that the application needs—a private one which is a direct dependency and a public one which is an indirect dependency through Pub:\nThe private Priv depends on the Pub and Zebra packages.\nThe public Priv has no dependencies.\nThe application also depends on the Pub package, which in turn depends on the public Priv and the same Zebra package which the private Priv package depends on.A materialized representation of this dependency graph looks like this:graph = Dict{UUID,Dict{Symbol,UUID}}(\n    # Priv – the private one:\n    UUID(\"ba13f791-ae1d-465a-978b-69c3ad90f72b\") => Dict{Symbol,UUID}(\n        :Pub   => UUID(\"c07ecb7d-0dc9-4db7-8803-fadaaeaf08e1\"),\n        :Zebra => UUID(\"f7a24cb4-21fc-4002-ac70-f0e3a0dd3f62\"),\n    ),\n    # Priv – the public one:\n    UUID(\"2d15fe94-a1f7-436c-a4d8-07a9a496e01c\") => Dict{Symbol,UUID}(),\n    # Pub:\n    UUID(\"c07ecb7d-0dc9-4db7-8803-fadaaeaf08e1\") => Dict{Symbol,UUID}(\n        :Priv  => UUID(\"2d15fe94-a1f7-436c-a4d8-07a9a496e01c\"),\n        :Zebra => UUID(\"f7a24cb4-21fc-4002-ac70-f0e3a0dd3f62\"),\n    ),\n    # Zebra:\n    UUID(\"f7a24cb4-21fc-4002-ac70-f0e3a0dd3f62\") => Dict{Symbol,UUID}(),\n)Given this dependency graph, when Julia sees import Priv in the Pub package—which has UUID c07ecb7d-0dc9-4db7-8803-fadaaeaf08e1—it looks up:graph[UUID(\"c07ecb7d-0dc9-4db7-8803-fadaaeaf08e1\")][:Priv]and gets 2d15fe94-a1f7-436c-a4d8-07a9a496e01c , which indicates that in the context of the Pub package,  import Priv refers to the public Priv package, rather than the private one which the app depends on directly. This is how the name Priv can refer to different packages in the main project than it does in one of the packages dependencies, which allows for name collisions in the package ecosystem.What happens if import Zebra is evaluated in the main App code base? Since Zebra does not appear in the project file, the import will fail even though Zebra does appear in the manifest file. Moreover, if import Zebra occurs in the public Priv package—the one with UUID 2d15fe94-a1f7-436c-a4d8-07a9a496e01c—then that would also fail since that Priv package has no declared dependencies in the manifest file and therefore cannot load any packages. The Zebra package can only be loaded by packages for which it appear as an explicit dependency in the manifest file: the  Pub package and one of the Priv packages.The paths map of a project environment is also determined by the manifest file if present and is empty if there is no manifest. The path of a package uuid named X is determined by these two rules:If the manifest stanza matching uuid has a path entry, use that path relative to the manifest file.\nOtherwise, if the manifest stanza matching uuid has a git-tree-sha1 entry, compute a deterministic hash function of uuid and git-tree-sha1—call it slug—and look for packages/X/$slug in each directory in the Julia DEPOT_PATH global array. Use the first such directory that exists.If applying these rules doesn\'t find a loadable path, the package should be considered not installed and the system should raise an error or prompt the user to install the appropriate package version.In the example manifest file above, to find the path of the first Priv package—the one with UUID ba13f791-ae1d-465a-978b-69c3ad90f72b—Julia looks for its stanza in the manifest file, sees that it has a path entry, looks at deps/Priv relative to the App project directory—let\'s suppose the App code lives in /home/me/projects/App—sees that /home/me/projects/App/deps/Priv exists and therefore loads Priv from there.If, on the other hand, Julia was loading the other Priv package—the one with UUID 2d15fe94-a1f7-436c-a4d8-07a9a496e01c—it finds its stanza in the manifest, see that it does not have a path entry, but that it does have a git-tree-sha1 entry. It then computes the slug for this UUID/SHA-1 pair, which is HDkr (the exact details of this computation aren\'t important, but it is consistent and deterministic). This means that the path to this Priv package will be packages/Priv/HDkr/src/Priv.jl in one of the package depots. Suppose the contents of DEPOT_PATH is [\"/users/me/.julia\", \"/usr/local/julia\"]; then Julia will look at the following paths to see if they exist:/home/me/.julia/packages/Priv/HDkr/src/Priv.jl\n/usr/local/julia/packages/Priv/HDkr/src/Priv.jlJulia uses the first of these that exists to load the public Priv package.Here is a materialized paths map for the App project environment:paths = Dict{Tuple{UUID,Symbol},String}(\n    # Priv – the private one:\n    (UUID(\"ba13f791-ae1d-465a-978b-69c3ad90f72b\"), :Priv) =>\n        # relative entry-point inside `App` repo:\n        \"/home/me/projects/App/deps/Priv/src/Priv.jl\",\n    # Priv – the public one:\n    (UUID(\"2d15fe94-a1f7-436c-a4d8-07a9a496e01c\"), :Priv) =>\n        # package installed in the system depot:\n        \"/usr/local/julia/packages/Priv/HDkr/src/Priv.jl\",\n    # Pub:\n    (UUID(\"c07ecb7d-0dc9-4db7-8803-fadaaeaf08e1\"), :Pub) =>\n        # package installed in the user depot:\n        \"/home/me/.julia/packages/Pub/oKpw/src/Pub.jl\",\n    # Zebra:\n    (UUID(\"f7a24cb4-21fc-4002-ac70-f0e3a0dd3f62\"), :Zebra) =>\n        # package installed in the system depot:\n        \"/usr/local/julia/packages/Zebra/me9k/src/Zebra.jl\",\n)This example map includes three different kinds of package locations:The private Priv package is \"vendored\" inside of App repository.\nThe public Priv and Zebra packages are in the system depot, where packages installed and managed by the system administrator live. These are available to all users on the system.\nThe Pub package is in the user depot, where packages installed by the user live. These are only available to the user who installed them."

    "title": "Package directories",
    "category": "section",
    "text": "Package directories provide a kind of environment that approximates package loading in Julia 0.6 and earlier, and which resembles package loading in many other dynamic languages. The set of packages available in a package directory corresponds to the set of subdirectories it contains that look like packages: if X/src/X.jl is a file in a package directory, then X is considered to be a package and X/src/X.jl is the file you load to get X. Which packages can \"see\" each other as dependencies depends on whether they contain project files or not and what appears in the [deps] sections of those project files.The roots map is determined by the subdirectories X of a package directory for which X/src/X.jl exists and whether X/Project.toml exists and has a top-level uuid entry. Specifically :X => uuid goes in roots for each such X where uuid is defined as:If X/Project.toml exists and has a uuid entry, then uuid is that value.\nIf X/Project.toml exists and but does not have a top-level UUID entry, uuid is a dummy UUID generated by hashing the canonical path of X/Project.toml.\nIf X/Project.toml does not exist, then uuid is the all-zero nil UUID.The dependency graph of a project directory is determined by the presence and contents of project files in the subdirectory of each package. The rules are:If a package subdirectory has no project file, then it is omitted from graph and import statements in its code are treated as top-level, the same as the main project and REPL.\nIf a package subdirectory has a project file, then the graph entry for its UUID is the [deps] map of the project file, which is considered to be empty if the section is absent.As an example, suppose a package directory has the following structure and content:Aardvark/\n    src/Aardvark.jl:\n        import Bobcat\n        import Cobra\n\nBobcat/\n    Project.toml:\n        [deps]\n        Cobra = \"4725e24d-f727-424b-bca0-c4307a3456fa\"\n        Dingo = \"7a7925be-828c-4418-bbeb-bac8dfc843bc\"\n\n    src/Bobcat.jl:\n        import Cobra\n        import Dingo\n\nCobra/\n    Project.toml:\n        uuid = \"4725e24d-f727-424b-bca0-c4307a3456fa\"\n        [deps]\n        Dingo = \"7a7925be-828c-4418-bbeb-bac8dfc843bc\"\n\n    src/Cobra.jl:\n        import Dingo\n\nDingo/\n    Project.toml:\n        uuid = \"7a7925be-828c-4418-bbeb-bac8dfc843bc\"\n\n    src/Dingo.jl:\n        # no importsHere is a corresponding roots structure, materialized as a dictionary:roots = Dict{Symbol,UUID}(\n    :Aardvark => UUID(\"00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000\"), # no project file, nil UUID\n    :Bobcat   => UUID(\"85ad11c7-31f6-5d08-84db-0a4914d4cadf\"), # dummy UUID based on path\n    :Cobra    => UUID(\"4725e24d-f727-424b-bca0-c4307a3456fa\"), # UUID from project file\n    :Dingo    => UUID(\"7a7925be-828c-4418-bbeb-bac8dfc843bc\"), # UUID from project file\n)Here is the corresponding graph structure, materialized as a dictionary:graph = Dict{UUID,Dict{Symbol,UUID}}(\n    # Bobcat:\n    UUID(\"85ad11c7-31f6-5d08-84db-0a4914d4cadf\") => Dict{Symbol,UUID}(\n        :Cobra => UUID(\"4725e24d-f727-424b-bca0-c4307a3456fa\"),\n        :Dingo => UUID(\"7a7925be-828c-4418-bbeb-bac8dfc843bc\"),\n    ),\n    # Cobra:\n    UUID(\"4725e24d-f727-424b-bca0-c4307a3456fa\") => Dict{Symbol,UUID}(\n        :Dingo => UUID(\"7a7925be-828c-4418-bbeb-bac8dfc843bc\"),\n    ),\n    # Dingo:\n    UUID(\"7a7925be-828c-4418-bbeb-bac8dfc843bc\") => Dict{Symbol,UUID}(),\n)A few general rules to note:A package without a project file can depend on any top-level dependency, and since every package in a package directory is available at the top-level, it can import all packages in the environment.\nA package with a project file cannot depend on one without a project file since packages with project files can only load packages in graph and packages without project files do not appear in graph.\nA package with a project file but no explicit UUID can only be depended on by packages without project files since dummy UUIDs assigned to these packages are strictly internal.Observe the following specific instances of these rules in our example:Aardvark can import on any of Bobcat, Cobra or Dingo; it does import Bobcat and Cobra.\nBobcat can and does import both Cobra and Dingo, which both have project files with UUIDs and are declared as dependencies in Bobcat\'s [deps] section.\nBobcat cannot possibly depend on Aardvark since Aardvark does not have a project file.\nCobra can and does import Dingo, which has a project file and UUID, and is declared as a dependency in Cobra\'s  [deps] section.\nCobra cannot depend on Aardvark or Bobcat since neither have real UUIDs.\nDingo cannot import anything because it has a project file without a [deps] section.The paths map in a package directory is simple: it maps subdirectory names to their corresponding entry-point paths. In other words, if the path to our example project directory is /home/me/animals then the paths map would be materialized as this dictionary:paths = Dict{Tuple{UUID,Symbol},String}(\n    (UUID(\"00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000\"), :Aardvark) =>\n        \"/home/me/AnimalPackages/Aardvark/src/Aardvark.jl\",\n    (UUID(\"85ad11c7-31f6-5d08-84db-0a4914d4cadf\"), :Bobcat) =>\n        \"/home/me/AnimalPackages/Bobcat/src/Bobcat.jl\",\n    (UUID(\"4725e24d-f727-424b-bca0-c4307a3456fa\"), :Cobra) =>\n        \"/home/me/AnimalPackages/Cobra/src/Cobra.jl\",\n    (UUID(\"7a7925be-828c-4418-bbeb-bac8dfc843bc\"), :Dingo) =>\n        \"/home/me/AnimalPackages/Dingo/src/Dingo.jl\",\n)Since all packages in a package directory environment are, by definition, subdirectories with the expected entry-point files, their paths map entries always have this form."

    "title": "Environment stacks",
    "category": "section",
    "text": "The third and final kind of environment is one that combines other environments by overlaying several of them, making the packages in each available in a single composite environment. These composite environments are called environment stacks. The Julia LOAD_PATH global defines an environment stack—the environment in which the Julia process operates. If you want your Julia process to have access only to the packages in one project or package directory, make it the only entry in LOAD_PATH. It is often quite useful, however, to have access to some of your favorite tools—standard libraries, profilers, debuggers, personal utilities, etc.—even if they are not dependencies of the project you\'re working on. By pushing an environment containing these tools onto the load path, you immediately have access to them in top-level code without needing to add them to your project.The mechanism for combining the roots, graph and paths data structures of the components of an environment stack is simple: they are simply merged as dictionaries, favoring earlier entries over later ones in the case of key collisions. In other words, if we have stack = [env₁, env₂, …] then we have:roots = reduce(merge, reverse([roots₁, roots₂, …]))\ngraph = reduce(merge, reverse([graph₁, graph₂, …]))\npaths = reduce(merge, reverse([paths₁, paths₂, …]))The subscripted rootsᵢ, graphᵢ and pathsᵢ variables correspond to the subscripted environments, envᵢ, contained stack. The reverse is present because merge favors the last argument rather than first when there are collisions between keys in its argument dictionaries. That\'s all there is to stacked environments. There are a couple of noteworthy features of this design:The primary environment—i.e.the first environment in a stack—is faithfully embedded in a stacked environment. The full dependency graph of the first environment in a stack is guaranteed to be included intact in the stacked environment including the same versions of all dependencies.\nPackages in non-primary environments can end up using incompatible versions of their dependencies even if their own environments are entirely compatible. This can happen when one of their dependencies is shadowed by a version in an earlier environment in the stack.Since the primary environment is typically the environment of a project you\'re working on, while environments later in the stack contain additional tools, this is the right tradeoff: it\'s better to break your dev tools but keep the project working. When such incompatibilities occur, you\'ll typically want to upgrade your dev tools to versions that are compatible with the main project."

    "text": "The Profile module provides tools to help developers improve the performance of their code. When used, it takes measurements on running code, and produces output that helps you understand how much time is spent on individual line(s). The most common usage is to identify \"bottlenecks\" as targets for optimization.Profile implements what is known as a \"sampling\" or statistical profiler.  It works by periodically taking a backtrace during the execution of any task. Each backtrace captures the currently-running function and line number, plus the complete chain of function calls that led to this line, and hence is a \"snapshot\" of the current state of execution.If much of your run time is spent executing a particular line of code, this line will show up frequently in the set of all backtraces. In other words, the \"cost\" of a given line–or really, the cost of the sequence of function calls up to and including this line–is proportional to how often it appears in the set of all backtraces.A sampling profiler does not provide complete line-by-line coverage, because the backtraces occur at intervals (by default, 1 ms on Unix systems and 10 ms on Windows, although the actual scheduling is subject to operating system load). Moreover, as discussed further below, because samples are collected at a sparse subset of all execution points, the data collected by a sampling profiler is subject to statistical noise.Despite these limitations, sampling profilers have substantial strengths:You do not have to make any modifications to your code to take timing measurements (in contrast to the alternative instrumenting profiler).\nIt can profile into Julia\'s core code and even (optionally) into C and Fortran libraries.\nBy running \"infrequently\" there is very little performance overhead; while profiling, your code can run at nearly native speed.For these reasons, it\'s recommended that you try using the built-in sampling profiler before considering any alternatives."

Indentation is used to indicate the nested sequence of function calls, with more-indented lines being deeper in the sequence of calls. In each line, the first \"field\" is the number of backtraces (samples) taken at this line or in any functions executed by this line. The second field is the file name and line number and the third field is the function name. Note that the specific line numbers may change as Julia\'s code changes; if you want to follow along, it\'s best to run this example yourself.In this example, we can see that the top level function called is in the file event.jl. This is the function that runs the REPL when you launch Julia. If you examine line 97 of REPL.jl, you\'ll see this is where the function eval_user_input() is called. This is the function that evaluates what you type at the REPL, and since we\'re working interactively these functions were invoked when we entered @profile myfunc(). The next line reflects actions taken in the @profile macro.The first line shows that 80 backtraces were taken at line 73 of event.jl, but it\'s not that this line was \"expensive\" on its own: the third line reveals that all 80 of these backtraces were actually triggered inside its call to eval_user_input, and so on. To find out which operations are actually taking the time, we need to look deeper in the call chain.The first \"important\" line in this output is this one:52 ./REPL[1]:2; myfunc()REPL refers to the fact that we defined myfunc in the REPL, rather than putting it in a file; if we had used a file, this would show the file name. The [1] shows that the function myfunc was the first expression evaluated in this REPL session. Line 2 of myfunc() contains the call to rand, and there were 52 (out of 80) backtraces that occurred at this line. Below that, you can see a call to dsfmt_fill_array_close_open! inside dSFMT.jl.A little further down, you see:28 ./REPL[1]:3; myfunc()Line 3 of myfunc contains the call to maximum, and there were 28 (out of 80) backtraces taken here. Below that, you can see the specific places in base/reduce.jl that carry out the time-consuming operations in the maximum function for this type of input data.Overall, we can tentatively conclude that generating the random numbers is approximately twice as expensive as finding the maximum element.

The major exception to this rule is garbage collection, which runs infrequently but tends to be quite expensive. (Since Julia\'s garbage collector is written in C, such events can be detected using the C=true output mode described below, or by using ProfileView.jl.)This illustrates the default \"tree\" dump; an alternative is the \"flat\" dump, which accumulates counts independent of their nesting:julia> Profile.print(format=:flat)\n Count File          Line Function\n  6714 ./<missing>     -1 anonymous\n  6714 ./REPL.jl       66 eval_user_input(::Any, ::Base.REPL.REPLBackend)\n  6714 ./REPL.jl       97 macro expansion\n  3821 ./REPL[1]        2 myfunc()\n  2893 ./REPL[1]        3 myfunc()\n  6714 ./REPL[7]        1 macro expansion\n  6714 ./boot.jl      235 eval(::Module, ::Any)\n  3511 ./dSFMT.jl      84 dsfmt_fill_array_close_open!(::Base.dSFMT.DSFMT_s...\n  6714 ./event.jl      73 (::Base.REPL.##1#2{Base.REPL.REPLBackend})()\n  6714 ./profile.jl    23 macro expansion\n  3511 ./random.jl    431 rand!(::MersenneTwister, ::Array{Float64,3}, ::In...\n   310 ./random.jl    277 rand\n   310 ./random.jl    278 rand\n   310 ./random.jl    366 rand\n   310 ./random.jl    369 rand\n  2893 ./reduce.jl    270 _mapreduce(::Base.#identity, ::Base.#scalarmax, :...\n     5 ./reduce.jl    420 mapreduce_impl(::Base.#identity, ::Base.#scalarma...\n   253 ./reduce.jl    426 mapreduce_impl(::Base.#identity, ::Base.#scalarma...\n  2592 ./reduce.jl    428 mapreduce_impl(::Base.#identity, ::Base.#scalarma...\n    43 ./reduce.jl    429 mapreduce_impl(::Base.#identity, ::Base.#scalarma...If your code has recursion, one potentially-confusing point is that a line in a \"child\" function can accumulate more counts than there are total backtraces.

Let\'s see the full declaration:function print(io::IO = stdout, data = fetch(); kwargs...)Let\'s first discuss the two positional arguments, and later the keyword arguments:io – Allows you to save the results to a buffer, e.g. a file, but the default is to print to stdout (the console).\ndata – Contains the data you want to analyze; by default that is obtained from Profile.fetch(), which pulls out the backtraces from a pre-allocated buffer. For example, if you want to profile the profiler, you could say:\ndata = copy(Profile.fetch())\nProfile.clear()\n@profile Profile.print(stdout, data) # Prints the previous results\nProfile.print()                      # Prints results from Profile.print()The keyword arguments can be any combination of:format – Introduced above, determines whether backtraces are printed  with (default, :tree) or without (:flat) indentation indicating tree  structure.\nC – If true, backtraces from C and Fortran code are shown (normally they are excluded). Try running the introductory example with Profile.print(C = true). This can be extremely helpful in deciding whether it\'s Julia code or C code that is causing a bottleneck; setting C = true also improves the interpretability of the nesting, at the cost of longer profile dumps.\ncombine – Some lines of code contain multiple operations; for example, s += A[i] contains both an array reference (A[i]) and a sum operation. These correspond to different lines in the generated machine code, and hence there may be two or more different addresses captured during backtraces on this line. combine = true lumps them together, and is probably what you typically want, but you can generate an output separately for each unique instruction pointer with combine = false.\nmaxdepth – Limits frames at a depth higher than maxdepth in the :tree format.\nsortedby – Controls the order in :flat format. :filefuncline (default) sorts by the source line, whereas :count sorts in order of number of collected samples.\nnoisefloor – Limits frames that are below the heuristic noise floor of the sample (only applies to format :tree). A suggested value to try for this is 2.0 (the default is 0). This parameter hides samples for which n <= noisefloor * √N, where n is the number of samples on this line, and N is the number of samples for the callee.\nmincount – Limits frames with less than mincount occurrences.File/function names are sometimes truncated (with ...), and indentation is truncated with a +n at the beginning, where n is the number of extra spaces that would have been inserted, had there been room. If you want a complete profile of deeply-nested code, often a good idea is to save to a file using a wide displaysize in an IOContext:open(\"/tmp/prof.txt\", \"w\") do s\n    Profile.print(IOContext(s, :displaysize => (24, 500)))\nend"

    "text": "@profile just accumulates backtraces, and the analysis happens when you call Profile.print(). For a long-running computation, it\'s entirely possible that the pre-allocated buffer for storing backtraces will be filled. If that happens, the backtraces stop but your computation continues. As a consequence, you may miss some important profiling data (you will get a warning when that happens).You can obtain and configure the relevant parameters this way:Profile.init() # returns the current settings\nProfile.init(n = 10^7, delay = 0.01)n is the total number of instruction pointers you can store, with a default value of 10^6. If your typical backtrace is 20 instruction pointers, then you can collect 50000 backtraces, which suggests a statistical uncertainty of less than 1%. This may be good enough for most applications.Consequently, you are more likely to need to modify delay, expressed in seconds, which sets the amount of time that Julia gets between snapshots to perform the requested computations. A very long-running job might not need frequent backtraces. The default setting is delay = 0.001. Of course, you can decrease the delay as well as increase it; however, the overhead of profiling grows once the delay becomes similar to the amount of time needed to take a backtrace (~30 microseconds on the author\'s laptop)."

    "category": "section",
    "text": "One of the most common techniques to improve performance is to reduce memory allocation. The total amount of allocation can be measured with @time and @allocated, and specific lines triggering allocation can often be inferred from profiling via the cost of garbage collection that these lines incur. However, sometimes it is more efficient to directly measure the amount of memory allocated by each line of code.To measure allocation line-by-line, start Julia with the --track-allocation=<setting> command-line option, for which you can choose none (the default, do not measure allocation), user (measure memory allocation everywhere except Julia\'s core code), or all (measure memory allocation at each line of Julia code). Allocation gets measured for each line of compiled code. When you quit Julia, the cumulative results are written to text files with .mem appended after the file name, residing in the same directory as the source file. Each line lists the total number of bytes allocated. The Coverage package contains some elementary analysis tools, for example to sort the lines in order of number of bytes allocated.In interpreting the results, there are a few important details. Under the user setting, the first line of any function directly called from the REPL will exhibit allocation due to events that happen in the REPL code itself. More significantly, JIT-compilation also adds to allocation counts, because much of Julia\'s compiler is written in Julia (and compilation usually requires memory allocation). The recommended procedure is to force compilation by executing all the commands you want to analyze, then call Profile.clear_malloc_data() to reset all allocation counters.  Finally, execute the desired commands and quit Julia to trigger the generation of the .mem files."

(If you\'ve not yet used @time in this session, it will also compile functions needed for timing.)  You should not take the results of this run seriously. For the second run, note that in addition to reporting the time, it also indicated that a significant amount of memory was allocated. We are here just computing a sum over all elements in a vector of 64-bit floats so there should be no need to allocate memory (at least not on the heap which is what @time reports).Unexpected memory allocation is almost always a sign of some problem with your code, usually a problem with type-stability or creating many small temporary arrays. Consequently, in addition to the allocation itself, it\'s very likely that the code generated for your function is far from optimal. Take such indications seriously and follow the advice below.If we instead pass x as an argument to the function it no longer allocates memory (the allocation reported below is due to running the @time macro in global scope) and is significantly faster after the first call:julia> x = rand(1000);\n\njulia> function sum_arg(x)\n           s = 0.0\n           for i in x\n               s += i\n           end\n           return s\n       end;\n\njulia> @time sum_arg(x)\n  0.007701 seconds (821 allocations: 43.059 KiB)\n496.84883432553846\n\njulia> @time sum_arg(x)\n  0.000006 seconds (5 allocations: 176 bytes)\n496.84883432553846The 5 allocations seen are from running the @time macro itself in global scope. If we instead run the timing in a function, we can see that indeed no allocations are performed:julia> time_sum(x) = @time sum_arg(x);\n\njulia> time_sum(x)\n  0.000001 seconds\n496.84883432553846In some situations, your function may need to allocate memory as part of its operation, and this can complicate the simple picture above. In such cases, consider using one of the tools below to diagnose problems, or write a version of your function that separates allocation from its algorithmic aspects (see Pre-allocating outputs).note: Note\nFor more serious benchmarking, consider the BenchmarkTools.jl package which among other things evaluates the function multiple times in order to reduce noise."

    "text": "Types can be declared without specifying the types of their fields:julia> struct MyAmbiguousType\n           a\n       endThis allows a to be of any type. This can often be useful, but it does have a downside: for objects of type MyAmbiguousType, the compiler will not be able to generate high-performance code. The reason is that the compiler uses the types of objects, not their values, to determine how to build code. Unfortunately, very little can be inferred about an object of type MyAmbiguousType:julia> b = MyAmbiguousType(\"Hello\")\nMyAmbiguousType(\"Hello\")\n\njulia> c = MyAmbiguousType(17)\nMyAmbiguousType(17)\n\njulia> typeof(b)\nMyAmbiguousType\n\njulia> typeof(c)\nMyAmbiguousTypeThe values of b and c have the same type, yet their underlying representation of data in memory is very different. Even if you stored just numeric values in field a, the fact that the memory representation of a UInt8 differs from a Float64 also means that the CPU needs to handle them using two different kinds of instructions. Since the required information is not available in the type, such decisions have to be made at run-time. This slows performance.You can do better by declaring the type of a. Here, we are focused on the case where a might be any one of several types, in which case the natural solution is to use parameters. For example:julia> mutable struct MyType{T<:AbstractFloat}\n           a::T\n       endThis is a better choice thanjulia> mutable struct MyStillAmbiguousType\n           a::AbstractFloat\n       endbecause the first version specifies the type of a from the type of the wrapper object. For example:julia> m = MyType(3.2)\nMyType{Float64}(3.2)\n\njulia> t = MyStillAmbiguousType(3.2)\nMyStillAmbiguousType(3.2)\n\njulia> typeof(m)\nMyType{Float64}\n\njulia> typeof(t)\nMyStillAmbiguousTypeThe type of field a can be readily determined from the type of m, but not from the type of t. Indeed, in t it\'s possible to change the type of the field a:julia> typeof(t.a)\nFloat64\n\njulia> t.a = 4.5f0\n4.5f0\n\njulia> typeof(t.a)\nFloat32In contrast, once m is constructed, the type of m.a cannot change:julia> m.a = 4.5f0\n4.5f0\n\njulia> typeof(m.a)\nFloat64The fact that the type of m.a is known from m\'s type—coupled with the fact that its type cannot change mid-function—allows the compiler to generate highly-optimized code for objects like m but not for objects like t.Of course, all of this is true only if we construct m with a concrete type. We can break this by explicitly constructing it with an abstract type:julia> m = MyType{AbstractFloat}(3.2)\nMyType{AbstractFloat}(3.2)\n\njulia> typeof(m.a)\nFloat64\n\njulia> m.a = 4.5f0\n4.5f0\n\njulia> typeof(m.a)\nFloat32For all practical purposes, such objects behave identically to those of MyStillAmbiguousType.It\'s quite instructive to compare the sheer amount code generated for a simple functionfunc(m::MyType) = m.a+1usingcode_llvm(func, Tuple{MyType{Float64}})\ncode_llvm(func, Tuple{MyType{AbstractFloat}})For reasons of length the results are not shown here, but you may wish to try this yourself. Because the type is fully-specified in the first case, the compiler doesn\'t need to generate any code to resolve the type at run-time. This results in shorter and faster code."

In most instances, this will probably suffice.While the compiler can now do its job perfectly well, there are cases where you might wish that your code could do different things depending on the element type of a. Usually the best way to achieve this is to wrap your specific operation (here, foo) in a separate function:julia> function sumfoo(c::MySimpleContainer)\n           s = 0\n           for x in c.a\n               s += foo(x)\n           end\n           s\n       end\nsumfoo (generic function with 1 method)\n\njulia> foo(x::Integer) = x\nfoo (generic function with 1 method)\n\njulia> foo(x::AbstractFloat) = round(x)\nfoo (generic function with 2 methods)This keeps things simple, while allowing the compiler to generate optimized code in all cases.However, there are cases where you may need to declare different versions of the outer function for different element types or types of the AbstractVector of the field a in MySimpleContainer. You could do it like this:julia> function myfunc(c::MySimpleContainer{<:AbstractArray{<:Integer}})\n           return c.a[1]+1\n       end\nmyfunc (generic function with 1 method)\n\njulia> function myfunc(c::MySimpleContainer{<:AbstractArray{<:AbstractFloat}})\n           return c.a[1]+2\n       end\nmyfunc (generic function with 2 methods)\n\njulia> function myfunc(c::MySimpleContainer{Vector{T}}) where T <: Integer\n           return c.a[1]+3\n       end\nmyfunc (generic function with 3 methods)julia> myfunc(MySimpleContainer(1:3))\n2\n\njulia> myfunc(MySimpleContainer(1.0:3))\n3.0\n\njulia> myfunc(MySimpleContainer([1:3;]))\n4"

But, if you\'re using one of these structures and happen to know the type of an element, it helps to share this knowledge with the compiler:function foo(a::Array{Any,1})\n    x = a[1]::Int32\n    b = x+1\n    ...\nendHere, we happened to know that the first element of a would be an Int32. Making an annotation like this has the added benefit that it will raise a run-time error if the value is not of the expected type, potentially catching certain bugs earlier.In the case that the type of a[1] is not known precisely, x can be declared via x = convert(Int32, a[1])::Int32. The use of the convert function allows a[1] to be any object convertible to an Int32 (such as UInt8), thus increasing the genericity of the code by loosening the type requirement. Notice that convert itself needs a type annotation in this context in order to achieve type stability. This is because the compiler cannot deduce the type of the return value of a function, even convert, unless the types of all the function\'s arguments are known.Type annotation will not enhance (and can actually hinder) performance if the type is constructed at run-time. This is because the compiler cannot use the annotation to specialize the subsequent code, and the type-check itself takes time. For example, in the code:function nr(a, prec)\n    ctype = prec == 32 ? Float32 : Float64\n    b = Complex{ctype}(a)\n    c = (b + 1.0f0)::Complex{ctype}\n    abs(c)\nendthe annotation of c harms performance. To write performant code involving types constructed at run-time, use the function-barrier technique discussed below, and ensure that the constructed type appears among the argument types of the kernel function so that the kernel operations are properly specialized by the compiler. For example, in the above snippet, as soon as b is constructed, it can be passed to another function k, the kernel. If, for example, function k declares b as an argument of type Complex{T}, where T is a type parameter, then a type annotation appearing in an assignment statement within k of the form:c = (b + 1.0f0)::Complex{T}does not hinder performance (but does not help either) since the compiler can determine the type of c at the time k is compiled."

For example, see vcat and hcat in abstractarray.jl, or the fill! function, which we could have used instead of writing our own fill_twos!.Functions like strange_twos occur when dealing with data of uncertain type, for example data loaded from an input file that might contain either integers, floats, strings, or something else."

This implies that the compiler can generate very efficient code for any future usage of A in the same function.But now let\'s say you want to write a function that creates a 3×3×... array in arbitrary dimensions; you might be tempted to write a functionjulia> function array3(fillval, N)\n           fill(fillval, ntuple(d->3, N))\n       end\narray3 (generic function with 1 method)\n\njulia> array3(5.0, 2)\n3×3 Array{Float64,2}:\n 5.0  5.0  5.0\n 5.0  5.0  5.0\n 5.0  5.0  5.0This works, but (as you can verify for yourself using @code_warntype array3(5.0, 2)) the problem is that the output type cannot be inferred: the argument N is a value of type Int, and type-inference does not (and cannot) predict its value in advance. This means that code using the output of this function has to be conservative, checking the type on each access of A; such code will be very slow.Now, one very good way to solve such problems is by using the function-barrier technique. However, in some cases you might want to eliminate the type-instability altogether. In such cases, one approach is to pass the dimensionality as a parameter, for example through Val{T}() (see \"Value types\"):julia> function array3(fillval, ::Val{N}) where N\n           fill(fillval, ntuple(d->3, Val(N)))\n       end\narray3 (generic function with 1 method)\n\njulia> array3(5.0, Val(2))\n3×3 Array{Float64,2}:\n 5.0  5.0  5.0\n 5.0  5.0  5.0\n 5.0  5.0  5.0Julia has a specialized version of ntuple that accepts a Val{::Int} instance as the second parameter; by passing N as a type-parameter, you make its \"value\" known to the compiler. Consequently, this version of array3 allows the compiler to predict the return type.However, making use of such techniques can be surprisingly subtle. For example, it would be of no help if you called array3 from a function like this:function call_array3(fillval, n)\n    A = array3(fillval, Val(n))\nendHere, you\'ve created the same problem all over again: the compiler can\'t guess what n is, so it doesn\'t know the type of Val(n). Attempting to use Val, but doing so incorrectly, can easily make performance worse in many situations. (Only in situations where you\'re effectively combining Val with the function-barrier trick, to make the kernel function more efficient, should code like the above be used.)An example of correct usage of Val would be:function filter3(A::AbstractArray{T,N}) where {T,N}\n    kernel = array3(1, Val(N))\n    filter(A, kernel)\nendIn this example, N is passed as a parameter, so its \"value\" is known to the compiler. Essentially, Val(T) works only when T is either hard-coded/literal (Val(3)) or already specified in the type-domain."

For example, you might imagine using it to store information, e.g.struct Car{Make, Model}\n    year::Int\n    ...more fields...\nendand then dispatch on objects like Car{:Honda,:Accord}(year, args...).This might be worthwhile when either of the following are true:You require CPU-intensive processing on each Car, and it becomes vastly more efficient if you know the Make and Model at compile time and the total number of different Make or Model that will be used is not too large.\nYou have homogenous lists of the same type of Car to process, so that you can store them all in an Array{Car{:Honda,:Accord},N}.When the latter holds, a function processing such a homogenous array can be productively specialized: Julia knows the type of each element in advance (all objects in the container have the same concrete type), so Julia can \"look up\" the correct method calls when the function is being compiled (obviating the need to check at run-time) and thereby emit efficient code for processing the whole list.When these do not hold, then it\'s likely that you\'ll get no benefit; worse, the resulting \"combinatorial explosion of types\" will be counterproductive. If items[i+1] has a different type than item[i], Julia has to look up the type at run-time, search for the appropriate method in method tables, decide (via type intersection) which one matches, determine whether it has been JIT-compiled yet (and do so if not), and then make the call. In essence, you\'re asking the full type- system and JIT-compilation machinery to basically execute the equivalent of a switch statement or dictionary lookup in your own code.Some run-time benchmarks comparing (1) type dispatch, (2) dictionary lookup, and (3) a \"switch\" statement can be found on the mailing list.Perhaps even worse than the run-time impact is the compile-time impact: Julia will compile specialized functions for each different Car{Make, Model}; if you have hundreds or thousands of such types, then every function that accepts such an object as a parameter (from a custom get_year function you might write yourself, to the generic push! function in Julia Base) will have hundreds or thousands of variants compiled for it. Each of these increases the size of the cache of compiled code, the length of internal lists of methods, etc. Excess enthusiasm for values-as-parameters can easily waste enormous resources."

The alternative to column-major ordering is row-major ordering, which is the convention adopted by C and Python (numpy) among other languages. Remembering the ordering of arrays can have significant performance effects when looping over arrays. A rule of thumb to keep in mind is that with column-major arrays, the first index changes most rapidly.

Assume that it is not important whether rows or columns are filled with these copies (perhaps the rest of the code can be easily adapted accordingly).

In the example above, we could have passed a SubArray rather than an Array, had we so desired.Taken to its extreme, pre-allocation can make your code uglier, so performance measurements and some judgment may be required.

    "text": "Julia has a special dot syntax that converts any scalar function into a \"vectorized\" function call, and any operator into a \"vectorized\" operator, with the special property that nested \"dot calls\" are fusing: they are combined at the syntax level into a single loop, without allocating temporary arrays. If you use .= and similar assignment operators, the result can also be stored in-place in a pre-allocated array (see above).In a linear-algebra context, this means that even though operations like vector + vector and vector * scalar are defined, it can be advantageous to instead use vector .+ vector and vector .* scalar because the resulting loops can be fused with surrounding computations. For example, consider the two functions:julia> f(x) = 3x.^2 + 4x + 7x.^3;\n\njulia> fdot(x) = @. 3x^2 + 4x + 7x^3 # equivalent to 3 .* x.^2 .+ 4 .* x .+ 7 .* x.^3;Both f and fdot compute the same thing. However, fdot (defined with the help of the @. macro) is significantly faster when applied to an array:julia> x = rand(10^6);\n\njulia> @time f(x);\n  0.019049 seconds (16 allocations: 45.777 MiB, 18.59% gc time)\n\njulia> @time fdot(x);\n  0.002790 seconds (6 allocations: 7.630 MiB)\n\njulia> @time f.(x);\n  0.002626 seconds (8 allocations: 7.630 MiB)That is, fdot(x) is ten times faster and allocates 1/6 the memory of f(x), because each * and + operation in f(x) allocates a new temporary array and executes in a separate loop. (Of course, if you just do f.(x) then it is as fast as fdot(x) in this example, but in many contexts it is more convenient to just sprinkle some dots in your expressions rather than defining a separate function for each vectorized operation.)"

If you are doing many operations on the slice, this can be good for performance because it is more efficient to work with a smaller contiguous copy than it would be to index into the original array. On the other hand, if you are just doing a few simple operations on the slice, the cost of the allocation and copy operations can be substantial.An alternative is to create a \"view\" of the array, which is an array object (a SubArray) that actually references the data of the original array in-place, without making a copy. (If you write to a view, it modifies the original array\'s data as well.) This can be done for individual slices by calling view, or more simply for a whole expression or block of code by putting @views in front of that expression. For example:julia> fcopy(x) = sum(x[2:end-1]);\n\njulia> @views fview(x) = sum(x[2:end-1]);\n\njulia> x = rand(10^6);\n\njulia> @time fcopy(x);\n  0.003051 seconds (7 allocations: 7.630 MB)\n\njulia> @time fview(x);\n  0.001020 seconds (6 allocations: 224 bytes)Notice both the 3× speedup and the decreased memory allocation of the fview version of the function."

If the subscripts are ever out of bounds, you may suffer crashes or silent corruption.\nUse @fastmath to allow floating point optimizations that are correct for real numbers, but lead to differences for IEEE numbers. Be careful when doing this, as this may change numerical results. This corresponds to the -ffast-math option of clang.\nWrite @simd in front of for loops to promise that the iterations are independent and may be reordered.  Note that in many cases, Julia can automatically vectorize code without the @simd macro; it is only beneficial in cases where such a transformation would otherwise be illegal, including cases like allowing floating-point re-associativity and ignoring dependent memory accesses (@simd ivdep). Again, be very careful when asserting @simd as erroneously annotating a loop with dependent iterations may result in unexpected results. In particular, note that setindex! on some AbstractArray subtypes is inherently dependent upon iteration order. This feature is experimental and could change or disappear in future versions of Julia.The common idiom of using 1:n to index into an AbstractArray is not safe if the Array uses unconventional indexing, and may cause a segmentation fault if bounds checking is turned off. Use LinearIndices(x) or eachindex(x) instead (see also offset-arrays).!!!note     While @simd needs to be placed directly in front of an innermost for loop, both @inbounds and @fastmath     can be applied to either single expressions or all the expressions that appear within nested blocks of code, e.g.,     using @inbounds begin or @inbounds for ....Here is an example with both @inbounds and @simd markup (we here use @noinline to prevent the optimizer from trying to be too clever and defeat our benchmark):@noinline function inner(x, y)\n    s = zero(eltype(x))\n    for i=eachindex(x)\n        @inbounds s += x[i]*y[i]\n    end\n    return s\nend\n\n@noinline function innersimd(x, y)\n    s = zero(eltype(x))\n    @simd for i = eachindex(x)\n        @inbounds s += x[i] * y[i]\n    end\n    return s\nend\n\nfunction timeit(n, reps)\n    x = rand(Float32, n)\n    y = rand(Float32, n)\n    s = zero(Float64)\n    time = @elapsed for j in 1:reps\n        s += inner(x, y)\n    end\n    println(\"GFlop/sec        = \", 2n*reps / time*1E-9)\n    time = @elapsed for j in 1:reps\n        s += innersimd(x, y)\n    end\n    println(\"GFlop/sec (SIMD) = \", 2n*reps / time*1E-9)\nend\n\ntimeit(1000, 1000)On a computer with a 2.4GHz Intel Core i5 processor, this produces:GFlop/sec        = 1.9467069505224963\nGFlop/sec (SIMD) = 17.578554163920018(GFlop/sec measures the performance, and larger numbers are better.)Here is an example with all three kinds of markup.

This is unusually large – in general, the speedup will be smaller. (In this particular example, the working set of the benchmark is small enough to fit into the L1 cache of the processor, so that memory access latency does not play a role, and computing time is dominated by CPU usage. In many real world programs this is not the case.) Also, in this case this optimization does not change the result – in general, the result will be slightly different. In some cases, especially for numerically unstable algorithms, the result can be very different.The annotation @fastmath re-arranges floating point expressions, e.g. changing the order of evaluation, or assuming that certain special cases (inf, nan) cannot occur. In this case (and on this particular computer), the main difference is that the expression 1 / (2*dx) in the function deriv is hoisted out of the loop (i.e. calculated outside the loop), as if one had written idx = 1 / (2*dx). In the loop, the expression ... / (2*dx) then becomes ... * idx, which is much faster to evaluate. Of course, both the actual optimization that is applied by the compiler as well as the resulting speedup depend very much on the hardware. You can examine the change in generated code by using Julia\'s code_native function.Note that @fastmath also assumes that NaNs will not occur during the computation, which can lead to surprising behavior:julia> f(x) = isnan(x);\n\njulia> f(NaN)\ntrue\n\njulia> f_fast(x) = @fastmath isnan(x);\n\njulia> f_fast(NaN)\nfalse"

A call set_zero_subnormals(true) grants permission for floating-point operations to treat subnormal inputs or outputs as zeros, which may improve performance on some hardware. A call set_zero_subnormals(false) enforces strict IEEE behavior for subnormal numbers.Below is an example where subnormals noticeably impact performance on some hardware:function timestep(b::Vector{T}, a::Vector{T}, Δt::T) where T\n    @assert length(a)==length(b)\n    n = length(b)\n    b[1] = 1                            # Boundary condition\n    for i=2:n-1\n        b[i] = a[i] + (a[i-1] - T(2)*a[i] + a[i+1]) * Δt\n    end\n    b[n] = 0                            # Boundary condition\nend\n\nfunction heatflow(a::Vector{T}, nstep::Integer) where T\n    b = similar(a)\n    for t=1:div(nstep,2)                # Assume nstep is even\n        timestep(b,a,T(0.1))\n        timestep(a,b,T(0.1))\n    end\nend\n\nheatflow(zeros(Float32,10),2)           # Force compilation\nfor trial=1:6\n    a = zeros(Float32,1000)\n    set_zero_subnormals(iseven(trial))  # Odd trials use strict IEEE arithmetic\n    @time heatflow(a,1000)\nendThis gives an output similar to  0.002202 seconds (1 allocation: 4.063 KiB)\n  0.001502 seconds (1 allocation: 4.063 KiB)\n  0.002139 seconds (1 allocation: 4.063 KiB)\n  0.001454 seconds (1 allocation: 4.063 KiB)\n  0.002115 seconds (1 allocation: 4.063 KiB)\n  0.001455 seconds (1 allocation: 4.063 KiB)Note how each even iteration is significantly faster.This example generates many subnormal numbers because the values in a become an exponentially decreasing curve, which slowly flattens out over time.Treating subnormals as zeros should be used with caution, because doing so breaks some identities, such as x-y == 0 implies x == y:julia> x = 3f-38; y = 2f-38;\n\njulia> set_zero_subnormals(true); (x - y, x == y)\n(0.0f0, false)\n\njulia> set_zero_subnormals(false); (x - y, x == y)\n(1.0000001f-38, false)In some applications, an alternative to zeroing subnormal numbers is to inject a tiny bit of noise.

Your code is being presented in form that has been heavily digested on its way to generating compiled machine code. Most of the expressions are annotated by a type, indicated by the ::T (where T might be Float64, for example). The most important characteristic of @code_warntype is that non-concrete types are displayed in red; in the above example, such output is shown in uppercase.At the top, the inferred return type of the function is shown as Body::Float64. The next lines represent the body of f in Julia\'s SSA IR form. The numbered boxes are labels and represent targets for jumps (via goto) in your code. Looking at the body, you can see that the first thing that happens is that pos is called and the return value has been inferred as the Union type UNION{FLOAT64, INT64} shown in uppercase since it is a non-concrete type. This means that we cannot know the exact return type of pos based on the input types. However, the result of y*xis a Float64 no matter if y is a Float64 or Int64 The net result is that f(x::Float64) will not be type-unstable in its output, even if some of the intermediate computations are type-unstable.How you use this information is up to you. Obviously, it would be far and away best to fix pos to be type-stable: if you did so, all of the variables in f would be concrete, and its performance would be optimal. However, there are circumstances where this kind of ephemeral type instability might not matter too much: for example, if pos is never used in isolation, the fact that f\'s output is type-stable (for Float64 inputs) will shield later code from the propagating effects of type instability. This is particularly relevant in cases where fixing the type instability is difficult or impossible. In such cases, the tips above (e.g., adding type annotations and/or breaking up functions) are your best tools to contain the \"damage\" from type instability. Also, note that even Julia Base has functions that are type unstable. For example, the function findfirst returns the index into an array where a key is found, or nothing if it is not found, a clear type instability. In order to make it easier to find the type instabilities that are likely to be important, Unions containing either missing or nothing are color highlighted in yellow, instead of red.The following examples may help you interpret expressions marked as containing non-leaf types:Function body starting with Body::UNION{T1,T2})\nInterpretation: function with unstable return type\nSuggestion: make the return value type-stable, even if you have to annotate it\ninvoke Main.g(%%x::Int64)::UNION{FLOAT64, INT64}\nInterpretation: call to a type-unstable function g.\nSuggestion: fix the function, or if necessary annotate the return value\ninvoke Base.getindex(%%x::Array{Any,1}, 1::Int64)::ANY\nInterpretation: accessing elements of poorly-typed arrays\nSuggestion: use arrays with better-defined types, or if necessary annotate the type of individual element accesses\nBase.getfield(%%x, :(:data))::ARRAY{FLOAT64,N} WHERE N\nInterpretation: getting a field that is of non-leaf type. In this case, ArrayContainer had a field data::Array{T}.

The inner function assigned to f is called a \"closure\". Inner functions are also used by the language for do-blocks and for generator expressions.This style of code presents performance challenges for the language. The parser, when translating it into lower-level instructions, substantially reorganizes the above code by extracting the inner function to a separate code block.  \"Captured\" variables such as r that are shared by inner functions and their enclosing scope are also extracted into a heap-allocated \"box\" accessible to both inner and outer functions because the language specifies that r in the inner scope must be identical to r in the outer scope even after the outer scope (or another inner function) modifies r.The discussion in the preceding paragraph referred to the \"parser\", that is, the phase of compilation that takes place when the module containing abmult is first loaded, as opposed to the later phase when it is first invoked. The parser does not \"know\" that Int is a fixed type, or that the statement r = -r transforms an Int to another Int. The magic of type inference takes place in the later phase of compilation.Thus, the parser does not know that r has a fixed type (Int). nor that r does not change value once the inner function is created (so that the box is unneeded).  Therefore, the parser emits code for box that holds an object with an abstract type such as Any, which requires run-time type dispatch for each occurrence of r.  This can be verified by applying @code_warntype to the above function.  Both the boxing and the run-time type dispatch can cause loss of performance.If captured variables are used in a performance-critical section of the code, then the following tips help ensure that their use is performant. First, if it is known that a captured variable does not change its type, then this can be declared explicitly with a type annotation (on the variable, not the right-hand side):function abmult2(r0::Int)\n    r::Int = r0\n    if r < 0\n        r = -r\n    end\n    f = x -> x * r\n    return f\nendThe type annotation partially recovers lost performance due to capturing because the parser can associate a concrete type to the object in the box. Going further, if the captured variable does not need to be boxed at all (because it will not be reassigned after the closure is created), this can be indicated with let blocks as follows.function abmult3(r::Int)\n    if r < 0\n        r = -r\n    end\n    f = let r = r\n            x -> x * r\n    end\n    return f\nendThe let block creates a new variable r whose scope is only the inner function. The second technique recovers full language performance in the presence of captured variables. Note that this is a rapidly evolving aspect of the compiler, and it is likely that future releases will not require this degree of programmer annotation to attain performance. In the mean time, some user-contributed packages like FastClosures automate the insertion of let statements as in abmult3."

Alternatively, you can wrap the contents of your test file in a module, as\nmodule Tst\n    using Tmp\n\n    <scratch work>\n\nend\nThe advantage is that you can now do using Tmp in your test code and can therefore avoid prepending Tmp. everywhere.

    "title": "Avoid writing overly-specific types",
    "category": "section",
    "text": "Code should be as generic as possible. Instead of writing:Complex{Float64}(x)it\'s better to use available generic functions:complex(float(x))The second version will convert x to an appropriate type, instead of always the same type.This style point is especially relevant to function arguments. For example, don\'t declare an argument to be of type Int or Int32 if it really could be any integer, expressed with the abstract type Integer. In fact, in many cases you can omit the argument type altogether, unless it is needed to disambiguate from other method definitions, since a MethodError will be thrown anyway if a type is passed that does not support any of the requisite operations. (This is known as duck typing.)For example, consider the following definitions of a function addone that returns one plus its argument:addone(x::Int) = x + 1                 # works only for Int\naddone(x::Integer) = x + oneunit(x)    # any integer type\naddone(x::Number) = x + oneunit(x)     # any numeric type\naddone(x) = x + oneunit(x)             # any type supporting + and oneunitThe last definition of addone handles any type supporting oneunit (which returns 1 in the same type as x, which avoids unwanted type promotion) and the + function with those arguments. The key thing to realize is that there is no performance penalty to defining only the general addone(x) = x + oneunit(x), because Julia will automatically compile specialized versions as needed. For example, the first time you call addone(12), Julia will automatically compile a specialized addone function for x::Int arguments, with the call to oneunit replaced by its inlined value 1. Therefore, the first three definitions of addone above are completely redundant with the fourth definition."

For example, in fill!(x, v), x is the object being mutated and it appears before the value to be inserted into x.\nType. Passing a type typically means that the output will have the given type. In parse(Int, \"1\"), the type comes before the string to parse. There are many such examples where the type appears first, but it\'s useful to note that in read(io, String), the IO argument appears before the type, which is in keeping with the order outlined here.\nInput not being mutated. In fill!(x, v), v is not being mutated and it comes after x.\nKey. For associative collections, this is the key of the key-value pair(s). For other indexed collections, this is the index.\nValue. For associative collections, this is the value of the key-value pair(s). In cases like fill!(x, v), this is v.\nEverything else. Any other arguments.\nVarargs. This refers to arguments that can be listed indefinitely at the end of a function call. For example, in Matrix{T}(undef, dims), the dimensions can be given as a Tuple, e.g. Matrix{T}(undef, (1,2)), or as Varargs, e.g. Matrix{T}(undef, 1, 2).\nKeyword arguments. In Julia keyword arguments have to come last anyway in function definitions; they\'re listed here for the sake of completeness.The vast majority of functions will not take every kind of argument listed above; the numbers merely denote the precedence that should be used for any applicable arguments to a function.There are of course a few exceptions. For example, in convert, the type should always come first. In setindex!, the value comes before the indices so that the indices can be provided as varargs.When designing APIs, adhering to this general order as much as possible is likely to give users of your functions a more consistent experience."

In some cases, you can get away with type piracy with little ill effect. In extreme cases, however, you can even crash Julia (e.g. if your method extension or redefinition causes invalid input to be passed to a ccall). Type piracy can complicate reasoning about code, and may introduce incompatibilities that are hard to predict and diagnose.As an example, suppose you wanted to define multiplication on symbols in a module:module A\nimport Base.*\n*(x::Symbol, y::Symbol) = Symbol(x,y)\nendThe problem is that now any other module that uses Base.* will also see this definition. Since Symbol is defined in Base and is used by other modules, this can change the behavior of unrelated code unexpectedly. There are several alternatives here, including using a different function name, or wrapping the Symbols in another type that you define.Sometimes, coupled packages may engage in type piracy to separate features from definitions, especially when the packages were designed by collaborating authors, and when the definitions are reusable. For example, one package might provide some types useful for working with colors; another package could define methods for those types that enable conversions between color spaces. Another example might be a package that acts as a thin wrapper for some C code, which another package might then pirate to implement a higher-level, Julia-friendly API."

    "title": "Why does Julia use native machine integer arithmetic?",
    "category": "section",
    "text": "Julia uses machine arithmetic for integer computations. This means that the range of Int values is bounded and wraps around at either end so that adding, subtracting and multiplying integers can overflow or underflow, leading to some results that can be unsettling at first:julia> typemax(Int)\n9223372036854775807\n\njulia> ans+1\n-9223372036854775808\n\njulia> -ans\n-9223372036854775808\n\njulia> 2*ans\n0Clearly, this is far from the way mathematical integers behave, and you might think it less than ideal for a high-level programming language to expose this to the user. For numerical work where efficiency and transparency are at a premium, however, the alternatives are worse.One alternative to consider would be to check each integer operation for overflow and promote results to bigger integer types such as Int128 or BigInt in the case of overflow. Unfortunately, this introduces major overhead on every integer operation (think incrementing a loop counter) – it requires emitting code to perform run-time overflow checks after arithmetic instructions and branches to handle potential overflows. Worse still, this would cause every computation involving integers to be type-unstable. As we mentioned above, type-stability is crucial for effective generation of efficient code. If you can\'t count on the results of integer operations being integers, it\'s impossible to generate fast, simple code the way C and Fortran compilers do.A variation on this approach, which avoids the appearance of type instability is to merge the Int and BigInt types into a single hybrid integer type, that internally changes representation when a result no longer fits into the size of a machine integer. While this superficially avoids type-instability at the level of Julia code, it just sweeps the problem under the rug by foisting all of the same difficulties onto the C code implementing this hybrid integer type. This approach can be made to work and can even be made quite fast in many cases, but has several drawbacks. One problem is that the in-memory representation of integers and arrays of integers no longer match the natural representation used by C, Fortran and other languages with native machine integers. Thus, to interoperate with those languages, we would ultimately need to introduce native integer types anyway. Any unbounded representation of integers cannot have a fixed number of bits, and thus cannot be stored inline in an array with fixed-size slots – large integer values will always require separate heap-allocated storage. And of course, no matter how clever a hybrid integer implementation one uses, there are always performance traps – situations where performance degrades unexpectedly. Complex representation, lack of interoperability with C and Fortran, the inability to represent integer arrays without additional heap storage, and unpredictable performance characteristics make even the cleverest hybrid integer implementations a poor choice for high-performance numerical work.An alternative to using hybrid integers or promoting to BigInts is to use saturating integer arithmetic, where adding to the largest integer value leaves it unchanged and likewise for subtracting from the smallest integer value. This is precisely what Matlab™ does:>> int64(9223372036854775807)\n\nans =\n\n  9223372036854775807\n\n>> int64(9223372036854775807) + 1\n\nans =\n\n  9223372036854775807\n\n>> int64(-9223372036854775808)\n\nans =\n\n -9223372036854775808\n\n>> int64(-9223372036854775808) - 1\n\nans =\n\n -9223372036854775808At first blush, this seems reasonable enough since 9223372036854775807 is much closer to 9223372036854775808 than -9223372036854775808 is and integers are still represented with a fixed size in a natural way that is compatible with C and Fortran. Saturated integer arithmetic, however, is deeply problematic. The first and most obvious issue is that this is not the way machine integer arithmetic works, so implementing saturated operations requires emitting instructions after each machine integer operation to check for underflow or overflow and replace the result with typemin(Int) or typemax(Int) as appropriate. This alone expands each integer operation from a single, fast instruction into half a dozen instructions, probably including branches. Ouch. But it gets worse – saturating integer arithmetic isn\'t associative. Consider this Matlab computation:>> n = int64(2)^62\n4611686018427387904\n\n>> n + (n - 1)\n9223372036854775807\n\n>> (n + n) - 1\n9223372036854775806This makes it hard to write many basic integer algorithms since a lot of common techniques depend on the fact that machine addition with overflow is associative. Consider finding the midpoint between integer values lo and hi in Julia using the expression (lo + hi) >>> 1:julia> n = 2^62\n4611686018427387904\n\njulia> (n + 2n) >>> 1\n6917529027641081856See? No problem. That\'s the correct midpoint between 2^62 and 2^63, despite the fact that n + 2n is -4611686018427387904. Now try it in Matlab:>> (n + 2*n)/2\n\nans =\n\n  4611686018427387904Oops. Adding a >>> operator to Matlab wouldn\'t help, because saturation that occurs when adding n and 2n has already destroyed the information necessary to compute the correct midpoint.Not only is lack of associativity unfortunate for programmers who cannot rely it for techniques like this, but it also defeats almost anything compilers might want to do to optimize integer arithmetic. For example, since Julia integers use normal machine integer arithmetic, LLVM is free to aggressively optimize simple little functions like f(k) = 5k-1. The machine code for this function is just this:julia> code_native(f, Tuple{Int})\n  .text\nFilename: none\n  pushq %rbp\n  movq  %rsp, %rbp\nSource line: 1\n  leaq  -1(%rdi,%rdi,4), %rax\n  popq  %rbp\n  retq\n  nopl  (%rax,%rax)The actual body of the function is a single leaq instruction, which computes the integer multiply and add at once. This is even more beneficial when f gets inlined into another function:julia> function g(k, n)\n           for i = 1:n\n               k = f(k)\n           end\n           return k\n       end\ng (generic function with 1 methods)\n\njulia> code_native(g, Tuple{Int,Int})\n  .text\nFilename: none\n  pushq %rbp\n  movq  %rsp, %rbp\nSource line: 2\n  testq %rsi, %rsi\n  jle L26\n  nopl  (%rax)\nSource line: 3\nL16:\n  leaq  -1(%rdi,%rdi,4), %rdi\nSource line: 2\n  decq  %rsi\n  jne L16\nSource line: 5\nL26:\n  movq  %rdi, %rax\n  popq  %rbp\n  retq\n  nopSince the call to f gets inlined, the loop body ends up being just a single leaq instruction. Next, consider what happens if we make the number of loop iterations fixed:julia> function g(k)\n           for i = 1:10\n               k = f(k)\n           end\n           return k\n       end\ng (generic function with 2 methods)\n\njulia> code_native(g,(Int,))\n  .text\nFilename: none\n  pushq %rbp\n  movq  %rsp, %rbp\nSource line: 3\n  imulq $9765625, %rdi, %rax    # imm = 0x9502F9\n  addq  $-2441406, %rax         # imm = 0xFFDABF42\nSource line: 5\n  popq  %rbp\n  retq\n  nopw  %cs:(%rax,%rax)Because the compiler knows that integer addition and multiplication are associative and that multiplication distributes over addition – neither of which is true of saturating arithmetic – it can optimize the entire loop down to just a multiply and an add. Saturated arithmetic completely defeats this kind of optimization since associativity and distributivity can fail at each loop iteration, causing different outcomes depending on which iteration the failure occurs in. The compiler can unroll the loop, but it cannot algebraically reduce multiple operations into fewer equivalent operations.The most reasonable alternative to having integer arithmetic silently overflow is to do checked arithmetic everywhere, raising errors when adds, subtracts, and multiplies overflow, producing values that are not value-correct. In this blog post, Dan Luu analyzes this and finds that rather than the trivial cost that this approach should in theory have, it ends up having a substantial cost due to compilers (LLVM and GCC) not gracefully optimizing around the added overflow checks. If this improves in the future, we could consider defaulting to checked integer arithmetic in Julia, but for now, we have to live with the possibility of overflow."

    "text": "Unlike many languages (for example, C and Java), Julia objects cannot be \"null\" by default. When a reference (variable, object field, or array element) is uninitialized, accessing it will immediately throw an error. This situation can be detected using the isdefined or isassigned functions.Some functions are used only for their side effects, and do not need to return a value. In these cases, the convention is to return the value nothing, which is just a singleton object of type Nothing. This is an ordinary type with no fields; there is nothing special about it except for this convention, and that the REPL does not print anything for it. Some language constructs that would not otherwise have a value also yield nothing, for example if false; end.For situations where a value x of type T exists only sometimes, the Union{T, Nothing} type can be used for function arguments, object fields and array element types as the equivalent of Nullable, Option or Maybe in other languages. If the value itself can be nothing (notably, when T is Any), the Union{Some{T}, Nothing} type is more appropriate since x == nothing then indicates the absence of a value, and x == Some(nothing) indicates the presence of a value equal to nothing. The something function allows unwrapping Some objects and using a default value instead of nothing arguments. Note that the compiler is able to generate efficient code when working with Union{T, Nothing} arguments or fields.To represent missing data in the statistical sense (NA in R or NULL in SQL), use the missing object. See the Missing Values section for more details.The empty tuple (()) is another form of nothingness. But, it should not really be thought of as nothing but rather a tuple of zero values.The empty (or \"bottom\") type, written as Union{} (an empty union type), is a type with no values and no subtypes (except itself). You will generally not need to use this type."

    "category": "section",
    "text": "In Julia, x += y gets replaced during parsing by x = x + y. For arrays, this has the consequence that, rather than storing the result in the same location in memory as x, it allocates a new array to store the result.While this behavior might surprise some, the choice is deliberate. The main reason is the presence of immutable objects within Julia, which cannot change their value once created.  Indeed, a number is an immutable object; the statements x = 5; x += 1 do not modify the meaning of 5, they modify the value bound to x. For an immutable, the only way to change the value is to reassign it.To amplify a bit further, consider the following function:function power_by_squaring(x, n::Int)\n    ispow2(n) || error(\"This implementation only works for powers of 2\")\n    while n >= 2\n        x *= x\n        n >>= 1\n    end\n    x\nendAfter a call like x = 5; y = power_by_squaring(x, 4), you would get the expected result: x == 5 && y == 625.  However, now suppose that *=, when used with matrices, instead mutated the left hand side.  There would be two problems:For general square matrices, A = A*B cannot be implemented without temporary storage: A[1,1] gets computed and stored on the left hand side before you\'re done using it on the right hand side.\nSuppose you were willing to allocate a temporary for the computation (which would eliminate most of the point of making *= work in-place); if you took advantage of the mutability of x, then this function would behave differently for mutable vs. immutable inputs. In particular, for immutable x, after the call you\'d have (in general) y != x, but for mutable x you\'d have y == x.Because supporting generic programming is deemed more important than potential performance optimizations that can be achieved by other means (e.g., using explicit loops), operators like += and *= work by rebinding new values."

Just as a line has no area (but still represents a set of things), a point has no length or any dimensions at all (but still represents a thing).\nWe define prod(()) to be 1, and the total number of elements in an array is the product of the size. The size of a zero-dimensional array is (), and therefore its length is 1.\nZero-dimensional arrays don\'t natively have any dimensions into which you index – they’re just A[]. We can apply the same \"trailing one\" rule for them as for all other array dimensionalities, so you can indeed index them as A[1], A[1,1], etc.It is also important to understand the differences to ordinary scalars. Scalars are not mutable containers (even though they are iterable and define things like length, getindex, e.g. 1[] == 1). In particular, if x = 0.0 is defined as a scalar, it is an error to attempt to change its value via x[] = 1.0. A scalar x can be converted into a zero-dimensional array containing it via fill(x), and conversely, a zero-dimensional array a can be converted to the contained scalar via a[]. Another difference is that a scalar can participate in linear algebra operations such as 2 * rand(2,2), but the analogous operation with a zero-dimensional array fill(2) * rand(2,2) is an error."

Releases generally occur every 6 months, giving you a stable platform for writing code.You may prefer the beta version of Julia if you don\'t mind being slightly behind the latest bugfixes and changes, but find the slightly faster rate of changes more appealing. Additionally, these binaries are tested before they are published to ensure they are fully functional.You may prefer the nightly version of Julia if you want to take advantage of the latest updates to the language, and don\'t mind if the version available today occasionally doesn\'t actually work.Finally, you may also consider building Julia from source for yourself. This option is mainly for those individuals who are comfortable at the command line, or interested in learning. If this describes you, you may also be interested in reading our guidelines for contributing.Links to each of these download types can be found on the download page at https://julialang.org/downloads/.

    "category": "section",
    "text": "Although MATLAB users may find Julia\'s syntax familiar, Julia is not a MATLAB clone. There are major syntactic and functional differences. The following are some noteworthy differences that may trip up Julia users accustomed to MATLAB:Julia arrays are indexed with square brackets, A[i,j].\nJulia arrays are not copied when assigned to another variable. After A = B, changing elements of B will modify A as well.\nJulia values are not copied when passed to a function. If a function modifies an array, the changes will be visible in the caller.\nJulia does not automatically grow arrays in an assignment statement. Whereas in MATLAB a(4) = 3.2 can create the array a = [0 0 0 3.2] and a(5) = 7 can grow it into a = [0 0 0 3.2 7], the corresponding Julia statement a[5] = 7 throws an error if the length of a is less than 5 or if this statement is the first use of the identifier a. Julia has push! and append!, which grow Vectors much more efficiently than MATLAB\'s a(end+1) = val.\nThe imaginary unit sqrt(-1) is represented in Julia as im, not i or j as in MATLAB.\nIn Julia, literal numbers without a decimal point (such as 42) create integers instead of floating point numbers. Arbitrarily large integer literals are supported. As a result, some operations such as 2^-1 will throw a domain error as the result is not an integer (see the FAQ entry on domain errors for details).\nIn Julia, multiple values are returned and assigned as tuples, e.g. (a, b) = (1, 2) or a, b = 1, 2. MATLAB\'s nargout, which is often used in MATLAB to do optional work based on the number of returned values, does not exist in Julia. Instead, users can use optional and keyword arguments to achieve similar capabilities.\nJulia has true one-dimensional arrays. Column vectors are of size N, not Nx1. For example, rand(N) makes a 1-dimensional array.\nIn Julia, [x,y,z] will always construct a 3-element array containing x, y and z.\nTo concatenate in the first (\"vertical\") dimension use either vcat(x,y,z) or separate with semicolons ([x; y; z]).\nTo concatenate in the second (\"horizontal\") dimension use either hcat(x,y,z) or separate with spaces ([x y z]).\nTo construct block matrices (concatenating in the first two dimensions), use either hvcat or combine spaces and semicolons ([a b; c d]).\nIn Julia, a:b and a:b:c construct AbstractRange objects. To construct a full vector like in MATLAB, use collect(a:b). Generally, there is no need to call collect though. An AbstractRange object will act like a normal array in most cases but is more efficient because it lazily computes its values. This pattern of creating specialized objects instead of full arrays is used frequently, and is also seen in functions such as range, or with iterators such as enumerate, and zip. The special objects can mostly be used as if they were normal arrays.\nFunctions in Julia return values from their last expression or the return keyword instead of listing the names of variables to return in the function definition (see The return Keyword for details).\nA Julia script may contain any number of functions, and all definitions will be externally visible when the file is loaded. Function definitions can be loaded from files outside the current working directory.\nIn Julia, reductions such as sum, prod, and max are performed over every element of an array when called with a single argument, as in sum(A), even if A has more than one dimension.\nIn Julia, parentheses must be used to call a function with zero arguments, like in rand().\nJulia discourages the used of semicolons to end statements. The results of statements are not automatically printed (except at the interactive prompt), and lines of code do not need to end with semicolons. println or @printf can be used to print specific output.\nIn Julia, if A and B are arrays, logical comparison operations like A == B do not return an array of booleans. Instead, use A .== B, and similarly for the other boolean operators like <, > and =.\nIn Julia, the operators &, |, and ⊻ (xor) perform the bitwise operations equivalent to and, or, and xor respectively in MATLAB, and have precedence similar to Python\'s bitwise operators (unlike C). They can operate on scalars or element-wise across arrays and can be used to combine logical arrays, but note the difference in order of operations: parentheses may be required (e.g., to select elements of A equal to 1 or 2 use (A .== 1) .| (A .== 2)).\nIn Julia, the elements of a collection can be passed as arguments to a function using the splat operator ..., as in xs=[1,2]; f(xs...).\nJulia\'s svd returns singular values as a vector instead of as a dense diagonal matrix.\nIn Julia, ... is not used to continue lines of code. Instead, incomplete expressions automatically continue onto the next line.\nIn both Julia and MATLAB, the variable ans is set to the value of the last expression issued in an interactive session. In Julia, unlike MATLAB, ans is not set when Julia code is run in non-interactive mode.\nJulia\'s structs do not support dynamically adding fields at runtime, unlike MATLAB\'s classes. Instead, use a Dict.\nIn Julia each module has its own global scope/namespace, whereas in MATLAB there is just one global scope.\nIn MATLAB, an idiomatic way to remove unwanted values is to use logical indexing, like in the expression x(x>3) or in the statement x(x>3) = [] to modify x in-place. In contrast, Julia provides the higher order functions filter and filter!, allowing users to write filter(z->z>3, x) and filter!(z->z>3, x) as alternatives to the corresponding transliterations x[x.>3] and x = x[x.>3]. Using filter! reduces the use of temporary arrays.\nThe analogue of extracting (or \"dereferencing\") all elements of a cell array, e.g. in vertcat(A{:}) in MATLAB, is written using the splat operator in Julia, e.g. as vcat(A...)."

    "category": "section",
    "text": "One of Julia\'s goals is to provide an effective language for data analysis and statistical programming. For users coming to Julia from R, these are some noteworthy differences:Julia\'s single quotes enclose characters, not strings.\nJulia can create substrings by indexing into strings. In R, strings must be converted into character vectors before creating substrings.\nIn Julia, like Python but unlike R, strings can be created with triple quotes \"\"\" ... \"\"\". This syntax is convenient for constructing strings that contain line breaks.\nIn Julia, varargs are specified using the splat operator ..., which always follows the name of a specific variable, unlike R, for which ... can occur in isolation.\nIn Julia, modulus is mod(a, b), not a %% b. % in Julia is the remainder operator.\nIn Julia, not all data structures support logical indexing. Furthermore, logical indexing in Julia is supported only with vectors of length equal to the object being indexed. For example:\nIn R, c(1, 2, 3, 4)[c(TRUE, FALSE)] is equivalent to c(1, 3).\nIn R, c(1, 2, 3, 4)[c(TRUE, FALSE, TRUE, FALSE)] is equivalent to c(1, 3).\nIn Julia, [1, 2, 3, 4][[true, false]] throws a BoundsError.\nIn Julia, [1, 2, 3, 4][[true, false, true, false]] produces [1, 3].\nLike many languages, Julia does not always allow operations on vectors of different lengths, unlike R where the vectors only need to share a common index range.  For example, c(1, 2, 3, 4) + c(1, 2) is valid R but the equivalent [1, 2, 3, 4] + [1, 2] will throw an error in Julia.\nJulia allows an optional trailing comma when that comma does not change the meaning of code. This can cause confusion among R users when indexing into arrays. For example, x[1,] in R would return the first row of a matrix; in Julia, however, the comma is ignored, so x[1,] == x[1], and will return the first element. To extract a row, be sure to use :, as in x[1,:].\nJulia\'s map takes the function first, then its arguments, unlike lapply(<structure>, function, ...) in R. Similarly Julia\'s equivalent of apply(X, MARGIN, FUN, ...) in R is mapslices where the function is the first argument.\nMultivariate apply in R, e.g. mapply(choose, 11:13, 1:3), can be written as broadcast(binomial, 11:13, 1:3) in Julia. Equivalently Julia offers a shorter dot syntax for vectorizing functions binomial.(11:13, 1:3).\nJulia uses end to denote the end of conditional blocks, like if, loop blocks, like while/ for, and functions. In lieu of the one-line if ( cond ) statement, Julia allows statements of the form if cond; statement; end, cond && statement and !cond || statement. Assignment statements in the latter two syntaxes must be explicitly wrapped in parentheses, e.g. cond && (x = value).\nIn Julia, <-, <<- and -> are not assignment operators.\nJulia\'s -> creates an anonymous function.\nJulia constructs vectors using brackets. Julia\'s [1, 2, 3] is the equivalent of R\'s c(1, 2, 3).\nJulia\'s * operator can perform matrix multiplication, unlike in R. If A and B are matrices, then A * B denotes a matrix multiplication in Julia, equivalent to R\'s A %*% B. In R, this same notation would perform an element-wise (Hadamard) product. To get the element-wise multiplication operation, you need to write A .* B in Julia.\nJulia performs matrix transposition using the transpose function and conjugated transposition using the \' operator or the adjoint function. Julia\'s transpose(A) is therefore equivalent to R\'s t(A). Additionally a non-recursive transpose in Julia is provided by the permutedims function.\nJulia does not require parentheses when writing if statements or for/while loops: use for i in [1, 2, 3] instead of for (i in c(1, 2, 3)) and if i == 1 instead of if (i == 1).\nJulia does not treat the numbers 0 and 1 as Booleans. You cannot write if (1) in Julia, because if statements accept only booleans. Instead, you can write if true, if Bool(1), or if 1==1.\nJulia does not provide nrow and ncol. Instead, use size(M, 1) for nrow(M) and size(M, 2) for ncol(M).\nJulia is careful to distinguish scalars, vectors and matrices.  In R, 1 and c(1) are the same. In Julia, they cannot be used interchangeably.\nJulia\'s diag and diagm are not like R\'s.\nJulia cannot assign to the results of function calls on the left hand side of an assignment operation: you cannot write diag(M) = fill(1, n).\nJulia discourages populating the main namespace with functions. Most statistical functionality for Julia is found in packages under the JuliaStats organization. For example:\nFunctions pertaining to probability distributions are provided by the Distributions package.\nThe DataFrames package provides data frames.\nGeneralized linear models are provided by the GLM package.\nJulia provides tuples and real hash tables, but not R-style lists. When returning multiple items, you should typically use a tuple or a named tuple: instead of list(a = 1, b = 2), use (1, 2) or (a=1, b=2).\nJulia encourages users to write their own types, which are easier to use than S3 or S4 objects in R. Julia\'s multiple dispatch system means that table(x::TypeA) and table(x::TypeB) act like R\'s table.TypeA(x) and table.TypeB(x).\nIn Julia, values are not copied when assigned or passed to a function. If a function modifies an array, the changes will be visible in the caller. This is very different from R and allows new functions to operate on large data structures much more efficiently.\nIn Julia, vectors and matrices are concatenated using hcat, vcat and hvcat, not c, rbind and cbind like in R.\nIn Julia, a range like a:b is not shorthand for a vector like in R, but is a specialized AbstractRange object that is used for iteration without high memory overhead. To convert a range into a vector, use collect(a:b).\nJulia\'s max and min are the equivalent of pmax and pmin respectively in R, but both arguments need to have the same dimensions.  While maximum and minimum replace max and min in R, there are important differences.\nJulia\'s sum, prod, maximum, and minimum are different from their counterparts in R. They all accept one or two arguments. The first argument is an iterable collection such as an array.  If there is a second argument, then this argument indicates the dimensions, over which the operation is carried out.  For instance, let A = [1 2; 3 4] in Julia and B <- rbind(c(1,2),c(3,4)) be the same matrix in R.  Then sum(A) gives the same result as sum(B), but sum(A, dims=1) is a row vector containing the sum over each column and sum(A, dims=2) is a column vector containing the sum over each row. This contrasts to the behavior of R, where separate colSums(B) and rowSums(B) functions provide these functionalities. If the dims keyword argument is a vector, then it specifies all the dimensions over which the sum is performed, while retaining the dimensions of the summed array, e.g. sum(A, dims=(1,2)) == hcat(10). It should be noted that there is no error checking regarding the second argument.\nJulia has several functions that can mutate their arguments. For example, it has both sort and sort!.\nIn R, performance requires vectorization. In Julia, almost the opposite is true: the best performing code is often achieved by using devectorized loops.\nJulia is eagerly evaluated and does not support R-style lazy evaluation. For most users, this means that there are very few unquoted expressions or column names.\nJulia does not support the NULL type. The closest equivalent is nothing, but it behaves like a scalar value rather than like a list. Use x == nothing instead of is.null(x).\nIn Julia, missing values are represented by the missing object rather than by NA. Use ismissing(x) instead of isna(x). The skipmissing function is generally used instead of na.rm=TRUE (though in some particular cases functions take a skipmissing argument).\nJulia lacks the equivalent of R\'s assign or get.\nIn Julia, return does not require parentheses.\nIn R, an idiomatic way to remove unwanted values is to use logical indexing, like in the expression x[x>3] or in the statement x = x[x>3] to modify x in-place. In contrast, Julia provides the higher order functions filter and filter!, allowing users to write filter(z->z>3, x) and filter!(z->z>3, x) as alternatives to the corresponding transliterations x[x.>3] and x = x[x.>3]. Using filter! reduces the use of temporary arrays."

In particular, the last element of a list or array is indexed with end in Julia, not -1 as in Python.\nJulia\'s for, if, while, etc. blocks are terminated by the end keyword. Indentation level is not significant as it is in Python.\nJulia has no line continuation syntax: if, at the end of a line, the input so far is a complete expression, it is considered done; otherwise the input continues. One way to force an expression to continue is to wrap it in parentheses.\nJulia arrays are column major (Fortran ordered) whereas NumPy arrays are row major (C-ordered) by default. To get optimal performance when looping over arrays, the order of the loops should be reversed in Julia relative to NumPy (see relevant section of Performance Tips).\nJulia\'s updating operators (e.g. +=, -=, ...) are not in-place whereas NumPy\'s are. This means A = [1, 1]; B = A; B += [3, 3] doesn\'t change values in A, it rather rebinds the name B to the result of the right-hand side B = B + 3, which is a new array. For in-place operation, use B .+= 3 (see also dot operators), explicit loops, or InplaceOps.jl.\nJulia evaluates default values of function arguments every time the method is invoked, unlike in Python where the default values are evaluated only once when the function is defined. For example, the function f(x=rand()) = x returns a new random number every time it is invoked without argument. On the other hand, the function g(x=[1,2]) = push!(x,3) returns [1,2,3] every time it is called as g().\nIn Julia % is the remainder operator, whereas in Python it is the modulus."

See the Julia documentation for the syntax for array construction (it has changed between versions).\nIn Julia, indexing of arrays, strings, etc. is 1-based not 0-based.\nJulia arrays are not copied when assigned to another variable. After A = B, changing elements of B will modify A as well. Updating operators like += do not operate in-place, they are equivalent to A = A + B which rebinds the left-hand side to the result of the right-hand side expression.\nJulia arrays are column major (Fortran ordered) whereas C/C++ arrays are row major ordered by default. To get optimal performance when looping over arrays, the order of the loops should be reversed in Julia relative to C/C++ (see relevant section of Performance Tips).\nJulia values are not copied when assigned or passed to a function. If a function modifies an array, the changes will be visible in the caller.\nIn Julia, whitespace is significant, unlike C/C++, so care must be taken when adding/removing whitespace from a Julia program.\nIn Julia, literal numbers without a decimal point (such as 42) create signed integers, of type Int, but literals too large to fit in the machine word size will automatically be promoted to a larger size type, such as Int64 (if Int is Int32), Int128, or the arbitrarily large BigInt type. There are no numeric literal suffixes, such as L, LL, U, UL, ULL to indicate unsigned and/or signed vs. unsigned. Decimal literals are always signed, and hexadecimal literals (which start with 0x like C/C++), are unsigned. Hexadecimal literals also, unlike C/C++/Java and unlike decimal literals in Julia, have a type based on the length of the literal, including leading 0s. For example, 0x0 and 0x00 have type UInt8, 0x000 and 0x0000 have type UInt16, then literals with 5 to 8 hex digits have type UInt32, 9 to 16 hex digits type UInt64 and 17 to 32 hex digits type UInt128. This needs to be taken into account when defining hexadecimal masks, for example ~0xf == 0xf0 is very different from ~0x000f == 0xfff0. 64 bit Float64 and 32 bit Float32 bit literals are expressed as 1.0 and 1.0f0 respectively. Floating point literals are rounded (and not promoted to the BigFloat type) if they can not be exactly represented.  Floating point literals are closer in behavior to C/C++. Octal (prefixed with 0o) and binary (prefixed with 0b) literals are also treated as unsigned.\nString literals can be delimited with either \"  or \"\"\", \"\"\" delimited literals can contain \" characters without quoting it like \"\\\"\" String literals can have values of other variables or expressions interpolated into them, indicated by $variablename or $(expression), which evaluates the variable name or the expression in the context of the function.\n// indicates a Rational number, and not a single-line comment (which is # in Julia)\n#= indicates the start of a multiline comment, and =# ends it.\nFunctions in Julia return values from their last expression(s) or the return keyword.  Multiple values can be returned from functions and assigned as tuples, e.g. (a, b) = myfunction() or a, b = myfunction(), instead of having to pass pointers to values as one would have to do in C/C++ (i.e. a = myfunction(&b).\nJulia does not require the use of semicolons to end statements. The results of expressions are not automatically printed (except at the interactive prompt, i.e. the REPL), and lines of code do not need to end with semicolons. println or @printf can be used to print specific output. In the REPL, ; can be used to suppress output. ; also has a different meaning within [ ], something to watch out for. ; can be used to separate expressions on a single line, but are not strictly necessary in many cases, and are more an aid to readability.\nIn Julia, the operator ⊻ (xor) performs the bitwise XOR operation, i.e. ^ in C/C++.  Also, the bitwise operators do not have the same precedence as C/++, so parenthesis may be required.\nJulia\'s ^ is exponentiation (pow), not bitwise XOR as in C/C++ (use ⊻, or xor, in Julia)\nJulia has two right-shift operators, >> and >>>.  >>> performs an arithmetic shift, >> always performs a logical shift, unlike C/C++, where the meaning of >> depends on the type of the value being shifted.\nJulia\'s -> creates an anonymous function, it does not access a member via a pointer.\nJulia does not require parentheses when writing if statements or for/while loops: use for i in [1, 2, 3] instead of for (int i=1; i <= 3; i++) and if i == 1 instead of if (i == 1).\nJulia does not treat the numbers 0 and 1 as Booleans. You cannot write if (1) in Julia, because if statements accept only booleans. Instead, you can write if true, if Bool(1), or if 1==1.\nJulia uses end to denote the end of conditional blocks, like if, loop blocks, like while/ for, and functions. In lieu of the one-line if ( cond ) statement, Julia allows statements of the form if cond; statement; end, cond && statement and !cond || statement. Assignment statements in the latter two syntaxes must be explicitly wrapped in parentheses, e.g. cond && (x = value), because of the operator precedence.\nJulia has no line continuation syntax: if, at the end of a line, the input so far is a complete expression, it is considered done; otherwise the input continues. One way to force an expression to continue is to wrap it in parentheses.\nJulia macros operate on parsed expressions, rather than the text of the program, which allows them to perform sophisticated transformations of Julia code. Macro names start with the @ character, and have both a function-like syntax, @mymacro(arg1, arg2, arg3), and a statement-like syntax, @mymacro arg1 arg2 arg3. The forms are interchangeable; the function-like form is particularly useful if the macro appears within another expression, and is often clearest. The statement-like form is often used to annotate blocks, as in the distributed for construct: @distributed for i in 1:n; #= body =#; end. Where the end of the macro construct may be unclear, use the function-like form.\nJulia now has an enumeration type, expressed using the macro @enum(name, value1, value2, ...) For example: @enum(Fruit, banana=1, apple, pear)\nBy convention, functions that modify their arguments have a ! at the end of the name, for example push!.\nIn C++, by default, you have static dispatch, i.e. you need to annotate a function as virtual, in order to have dynamic dispatch. On the other hand, in Julia every method is \"virtual\" (although it\'s more general than that since methods are dispatched on every argument type, not only this, using the most-specific-declaration rule)."

Functions are grouped by topic below.Some general notes:To use module functions, use import Module to import the module, and Module.fn(x) to use the functions.\nAlternatively, using Module will import all exported Module functions into the current namespace.\nBy convention, function names ending with an exclamation point (!) modify their arguments.

Using @simd gives the compiler a little extra leeway to make it possible in more situations. In either case, your inner loop should have the following properties to allow vectorization:\n\n* The loop must be an innermost loop\n* The loop body must be straight-line code. Therefore, [`@inbounds`](@ref) is\n  currently needed for all array accesses.

With macroexpand the expression expands in the module given as the first argument.\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Define these two functions for custom types to override how they are stored in a hash table.IdDict is a special hash table where the keys are always object identities.WeakKeyDict is a hash table implementation where the keys are weak references to objects, and thus may be garbage collected even when referenced in a hash table. Like Dict it uses hash for hashing and isequal for equality, unlike Dict it does not convert keys on insertion.Dicts can be created by passing pair objects constructed with => to a Dict constructor: Dict(\"A\"=>1, \"B\"=>2). This call will attempt to infer type information from the keys and values (i.e. this example creates a Dict{String, Int64}). To explicitly specify types use the syntax Dict{KeyType,ValueType}(...). For example, Dict{String,Int32}(\"A\"=>1, \"B\"=>2).Dictionaries may also be created with generators. For example, Dict(i => f(i) for i = 1:10).Given a dictionary D, the syntax D[x] returns the value of key x (if it exists) or throws an error, and D[x] = y stores the key-value pair x => y in D (replacing any existing value for the key x).  Multiple arguments to D[...] are converted to tuples; for example, the syntax D[x,y]  is equivalent to D[(x,y)], i.e. it refers to the value keyed by the tuple (x,y).Base.Dict\nBase.IdDict\nBase.WeakKeyDict\nBase.ImmutableDict\nBase.haskey\nBase.get(::Any, ::Any, ::Any)\nBase.get\nBase.get!(::Any, ::Any, ::Any)\nBase.get!(::Function, ::Any, ::Any)\nBase.getkey\nBase.delete!\nBase.pop!(::Any, ::Any, ::Any)\nBase.keys\nBase.values\nBase.pairs\nBase.merge\nBase.merge!(::AbstractDict, ::AbstractDict...)\nBase.merge!(::Function, ::AbstractDict, ::AbstractDict...)\nBase.sizehint!\nBase.keytype\nBase.valtypeFully implemented by:IdDict\nDict\nWeakKeyDictPartially implemented by:BitSet\nSet\nEnvDict\nArray\nBitArray\nImmutableDict\nIterators.Pairs"

For collections, == is generally called recursively on all contents, though other properties (like the shape for arrays) may also be taken into account.\n\nThis operator follows IEEE semantics for floating-point numbers: 0.0 == -0.0 and NaN != NaN.\n\nThe result is of type Bool, except when one of the operands is missing, in which case missing is returned (three-valued logic). For collections, missing is returned if at least one of the operands contains a missing value and all non-missing values are equal. Use isequal or === to always get a Bool result.\n\nImplementation\n\nNew numeric types should implement this function for two arguments of the new type, and handle comparison to other types via promotion rules where possible.\n\nisequal falls back to ==, so new methods of == will be used by the Dict type to compare keys. If your type will be used as a dictionary key, it should therefore also implement hash.\n\n\n\n\n\n==(x)\n\nCreate a function that compares its argument to x using ==, i.e. a function equivalent to y -> y == x.\n\nThe returned function is of type Base.Fix2{typeof(==)}, which can be used to implement specialized methods.\n\n\n\n\n\n==(a::AbstractString, b::AbstractString) -> Bool\n\nTest whether two strings are equal character by character (technically, Unicode code point by code point).\n\nExamples\n\njulia> \"abc\" == \"abc\"\ntrue\n\njulia> \"abc\" == \"αβγ\"\nfalse\n\n\n\n\n\n"

The default atol is zero and the default rtol depends on the types of x and y. The keyword argument nans determines whether or not NaN values are considered equal (defaults to false).\n\nFor real or complex floating-point values, if an atol > 0 is not specified, rtol defaults to the square root of eps of the type of x or y, whichever is bigger (least precise). This corresponds to requiring equality of about half of the significand digits. Otherwise, e.g. for integer arguments or if an atol > 0 is supplied, rtol defaults to zero.\n\nx and y may also be arrays of numbers, in which case norm defaults to vecnorm but may be changed by passing a norm::Function keyword argument. (For numbers, norm is the same thing as abs.) When x and y are arrays, if norm(x-y) is not finite (i.e. ±Inf or NaN), the comparison falls back to checking whether all elements of x and y are approximately equal component-wise.\n\nThe binary operator ≈ is equivalent to isapprox with the default arguments, and x ≉ y is equivalent to !isapprox(x,y).\n\nNote that x ≈ 0 (i.e., comparing to zero with the default tolerances) is equivalent to x == 0 since the default atol is 0.  In such cases, you should either supply an appropriate atol (or use norm(x) ≤ atol) or rearrange your code (e.g. use x ≈ y rather than x - y ≈ 0).   It is not possible to pick a nonzero atol automatically because it depends on the overall scaling (the \"units\") of your problem: for example, in x - y ≈ 0, atol=1e-9 is an absurdly small tolerance if x is the radius of the Earth in meters, but an absurdly large tolerance if x is the radius of a Hydrogen atom in meters.\n\nExamples\n\njulia> 0.1 ≈ (0.1 - 1e-10)\ntrue\n\njulia> isapprox(10, 11; atol = 2)\ntrue\n\njulia> isapprox([10.0^9, 1.0], [10.0^9, 2.0])\ntrue\n\njulia> 1e-10 ≈ 0\nfalse\n\njulia> isapprox(1e-10, 0, atol=1e-8)\ntrue\n\n\n\n\n\n"

A character represents a Unicode code point, and can be converted to an integer via the codepoint function in order to obtain the numerical value of the code point, or constructed from the same integer. These numerical values determine how characters are compared with < and ==, for example.  New T <: AbstractChar types should define a codepoint(::T) method and a T(::UInt32) constructor, at minimum.\n\nA given AbstractChar subtype may be capable of representing only a subset of Unicode, in which case conversion from an unsupported UInt32 value may throw an error.  Conversely, the built-in Char type represents a superset of Unicode (in order to losslessly encode invalid byte streams), in which case conversion of a non-Unicode value to UInt32 throws an error. The isvalid function can be used to check which codepoints are representable in a given AbstractChar type.\n\nInternally, an AbstractChar type may use a variety of encodings.  Conversion via codepoint(char) will not reveal this encoding because it always returns the Unicode value of the character. print(io, c) of any c::AbstractChar produces an encoding determined by io (UTF-8 for all built-in IO types), via conversion to Char if necessary.\n\nwrite(io, c), in contrast, may emit an encoding depending on typeof(c), and read(io, typeof(c)) should read the same encoding as write.

If A has conventional indexing, this will be identical to Array{Int}(undef, size(A)), but if A has unconventional indexing then the indices of the result will match A.\n\nsimilar(BitArray, (axes(A, 2),))\n\nwould create a 1-dimensional logical array whose indices match those of the columns of A.\n\n\n\n\n\n"

The input vector will have a length of batch_size or less.\n\nThe following examples highlight execution in different tasks by returning the objectid of the tasks in which the mapping function is executed.\n\nFirst, with ntasks undefined, each element is processed in a different task.\n\njulia> tskoid() = objectid(current_task());\n\njulia> asyncmap(x->tskoid(), 1:5)\n5-element Array{UInt64,1}:\n 0x6e15e66c75c75853\n 0x440f8819a1baa682\n 0x9fb3eeadd0c83985\n 0xebd3e35fe90d4050\n 0x29efc93edce2b961\n\njulia> length(unique(asyncmap(x->tskoid(), 1:5)))\n5\n\nWith ntasks=2 all elements are processed in 2 tasks.\n\njulia> asyncmap(x->tskoid(), 1:5; ntasks=2)\n5-element Array{UInt64,1}:\n 0x027ab1680df7ae94\n 0xa23d2f80cd7cf157\n 0x027ab1680df7ae94\n 0xa23d2f80cd7cf157\n 0x027ab1680df7ae94\n\njulia> length(unique(asyncmap(x->tskoid(), 1:5; ntasks=2)))\n2\n\nWith batch_size defined, the mapping function needs to be changed to accept an array of argument tuples and return an array of results. map is used in the modified mapping function to achieve this.\n\njulia> batch_func(input) = map(x->string(\"args_tuple: \", x, \", element_val: \", x[1], \", task: \", tskoid()), input)\nbatch_func (generic function with 1 method)\n\njulia> asyncmap(batch_func, 1:5; ntasks=2, batch_size=2)\n5-element Array{String,1}:\n \"args_tuple: (1,), element_val: 1, task: 9118321258196414413\"\n \"args_tuple: (2,), element_val: 2, task: 4904288162898683522\"\n \"args_tuple: (3,), element_val: 3, task: 9118321258196414413\"\n \"args_tuple: (4,), element_val: 4, task: 4904288162898683522\"\n \"args_tuple: (5,), element_val: 5, task: 9118321258196414413\"\n\nnote: Note\nCurrently, all tasks in Julia are executed in a single OS thread co-operatively.

(Note that the MIME\"\" notation only supports literal strings; to construct MIME types in a more flexible manner use MIME{Symbol(\"\")}.)\n\nFor example, if you define a MyImage type and know how to write it to a PNG file, you could define a function show(io, ::MIME\"image/png\", x::MyImage) = ... to allow your images to be displayed on any PNG-capable AbstractDisplay (such as IJulia). As usual, be sure to import Base.show in order to add new methods to the built-in Julia function show.\n\nThe default MIME type is MIME\"text/plain\". There is a fallback definition for text/plain output that calls show with 2 arguments.

Then, for each MIME type (mime string) that can be displayed on D, one should define a function display(d::D, ::MIME\"mime\", x) = ... that displays x as that MIME type, usually by calling show(io, mime, x) or repr(io, mime, x). A MethodError should be thrown if x cannot be displayed as that MIME type; this is automatic if one calls show or repr. Finally, one should define a function display(d::D, x) that queries showable(mime, x) for the mime types supported by D and displays the \"best\" one; a MethodError should be thrown if no supported MIME types are found for x.  Similarly, some subtypes may wish to override redisplay(d::D, ...). (Again, one should import Base.display to add new methods to display.) The return values of these functions are up to the implementation (since in some cases it may be useful to return a display \"handle\" of some type).  The display functions for D can then be called directly, but they can also be invoked automatically from display(x) simply by pushing a new display onto the display-backend stack with:Base.Multimedia.pushdisplay\nBase.Multimedia.popdisplay\nBase.Multimedia.TextDisplay\nBase.Multimedia.istextmime"

It specifies the dimension(s) over which the slices are sorted.\n\nE.g., if A is a matrix, dims=1 will sort rows, dims=2 will sort columns.

E.g., if A is a a 2x2x2 array, sortslices(A, dims=3) will sort slices within the 3rd dimension, passing the 2x2 slices A[:, :, 1] and A[:, :, 2] to the comparison function. Note that while there is no default order on higher-dimensional slices, you may use the by or lt keyword argument to specify such an order.\n\nIf dims is a tuple, the order of the dimensions in dims is relevant and specifies the linear order of the slices. E.g., if A is three dimensional and dims is (1, 2), the orderings of the first two dimensions are re-arranged such such that the slices (of the remaining third dimension) are sorted. If dims is (2, 1) instead, the same slices will be taken, but the result order will be row-major instead.\n\nHigher dimensional examples\n\njulia> A = permutedims(reshape([4 3; 2 1; \'A\' \'B\'; \'C\' \'D\'], (2, 2, 2)), (1, 3, 2))\n2×2×2 Array{Any,3}:\n[:, :, 1] =\n 4  3\n 2  1\n\n[:, :, 2] =\n \'A\'  \'B\'\n \'C\'  \'D\'\n\njulia> sortslices(A, dims=(1,2))\n2×2×2 Array{Any,3}:\n[:, :, 1] =\n 1  3\n 2  4\n\n[:, :, 2] =\n \'D\'  \'B\'\n \'C\'  \'A\'\n\njulia> sortslices(A, dims=(2,1))\n2×2×2 Array{Any,3}:\n[:, :, 1] =\n 1  2\n 3  4\n\n[:, :, 2] =\n \'D\'  \'C\'\n \'B\'  \'A\'\n\njulia> sortslices(reshape([5; 4; 3; 2; 1], (1,1,5)), dims=3, by=x->x[1,1])\n1×1×5 Array{Int64,3}:\n[:, :, 1] =\n 1\n\n[:, :, 2] =\n 2\n\n[:, :, 3] =\n 3\n\n[:, :, 4] =\n 4\n\n[:, :, 5] =\n 5\n\n\n\n\n\n"

It is efficient for very small n, and is used internally by QuickSort.QuickSort is an O(n log n) sorting algorithm which is in-place, very fast, but not stable – i.e. elements which are considered equal will not remain in the same order in which they originally appeared in the array to be sorted. QuickSort is the default algorithm for numeric values, including integers and floats.PartialQuickSort(k) is similar to QuickSort, but the output array is only sorted up to index k if k is an integer, or in the range of k if k is an OrdinalRange. For example:x = rand(1:500, 100)\nk = 50\nk2 = 50:100\ns = sort(x; alg=QuickSort)\nps = sort(x; alg=PartialQuickSort(k))\nqs = sort(x; alg=PartialQuickSort(k2))\nmap(issorted, (s, ps, qs))             # => (true, false, false)\nmap(x->issorted(x[1:k]), (s, ps, qs))  # => (true, true, false)\nmap(x->issorted(x[k2]), (s, ps, qs))   # => (true, false, true)\ns[1:k] == ps[1:k]                      # => true\ns[k2] == qs[k2]                        # => trueMergeSort is an O(n log n) stable sorting algorithm but is not in-place – it requires a temporary array of half the size of the input array – and is typically not quite as fast as QuickSort. It is the default algorithm for non-numeric data.The default sorting algorithms are chosen on the basis that they are fast and stable, or appear to be so. For numeric types indeed, QuickSort is selected as it is faster and indistinguishable in this case from a stable sort (unless the array records its mutations in some way). The stability property comes at a non-negligible cost, so if you don\'t need it, you may want to explicitly specify your preferred algorithm, e.g. sort!(v, alg=QuickSort).The mechanism by which Julia picks default sorting algorithms is implemented via the Base.Sort.defalg function. It allows a particular algorithm to be registered as the default in all sorting functions for specific arrays. For example, here are the two default methods from sort.jl:defalg(v::AbstractArray) = MergeSort\ndefalg(v::AbstractArray{<:Number}) = QuickSortAs for numeric arrays, choosing a non-stable default algorithm for array types for which the notion of a stable sort is meaningless (i.e. when two values comparing equal can not be distinguished) may make sense."

For example, the following program, when compiled with julia -O3 generates two SIMD addition instructions (addps) on x86 systems:const m128 = NTuple{4,VecElement{Float32}}\n\nfunction add(a::m128, b::m128)\n    (VecElement(a[1].value+b[1].value),\n     VecElement(a[2].value+b[2].value),\n     VecElement(a[3].value+b[3].value),\n     VecElement(a[4].value+b[4].value))\nend\n\ntriple(c::m128) = add(add(c,c),c)\n\ncode_native(triple,(m128,))However, since the automatic vectorization cannot be relied upon, future use will mostly be via libraries that use llvmcall."

    "text": "DocTestSetup = :(using Dates)The Dates module provides two types for working with dates: Date and DateTime, representing day and millisecond precision, respectively; both are subtypes of the abstract TimeType. The motivation for distinct types is simple: some operations are much simpler, both in terms of code and mental reasoning, when the complexities of greater precision don\'t have to be dealt with. For example, since the Date type only resolves to the precision of a single date (i.e. no hours, minutes, or seconds), normal considerations for time zones, daylight savings/summer time, and leap seconds are unnecessary and avoided.Both Date and DateTime are basically immutable Int64 wrappers. The single instant field of either type is actually a UTInstant{P} type, which represents a continuously increasing machine timeline based on the UT second [1]. The DateTime type is not aware of time zones (naive, in Python parlance), analogous to a LocalDateTime in Java 8. Additional time zone functionality can be added through the TimeZones.jl package, which compiles the IANA time zone database. Both Date and DateTime are based on the ISO 8601 standard, which follows the proleptic Gregorian calendar. One note is that the ISO 8601 standard is particular about BC/BCE dates. In general, the last day of the BC/BCE era, 1-12-31 BC/BCE, was followed by 1-1-1 AD/CE, thus no year zero exists. The ISO standard, however, states that 1 BC/BCE is year zero, so 0000-12-31 is the day before 0001-01-01, and year -0001 (yes, negative one for the year) is 2 BC/BCE, year -0002 is 3 BC/BCE, etc.[1]: The notion of the UT second is actually quite fundamental. There are basically two different notions of time generally accepted, one based on the physical rotation of the earth (one full rotation = 1 day), the other based on the SI second (a fixed, constant value). These are radically different! Think about it, a \"UT second\", as defined relative to the rotation of the earth, may have a different absolute length depending on the day! Anyway, the fact that Date and DateTime are based on UT seconds is a simplifying, yet honest assumption so that things like leap seconds and all their complexity can be avoided. This basis of time is formally called UT or UT1. Basing types on the UT second basically means that every minute has 60 seconds and every day has 24 hours and leads to more natural calculations when working with calendar dates."

Format strings work by the notion of defining delimited or fixed-width \"slots\" that contain a period to parse and passing the text to parse and format string to a Date or DateTime constructor, of the form Date(\"2015-01-01\",\"y-m-d\") or DateTime(\"20150101\",\"yyyymmdd\").Delimited slots are marked by specifying the delimiter the parser should expect between two subsequent periods; so \"y-m-d\" lets the parser know that between the first and second slots in a date string like \"2014-07-16\", it should find the - character. The y, m, and d characters let the parser know which periods to parse in each slot.Fixed-width slots are specified by repeating the period character the number of times corresponding to the width with no delimiter between characters. So \"yyyymmdd\" would correspond to a date string like \"20140716\". The parser distinguishes a fixed-width slot by the absence of a delimiter, noting the transition \"yyyymm\" from one period character to the next.Support for text-form month parsing is also supported through the u and U characters, for abbreviated and full-length month names, respectively. By default, only English month names are supported, so u corresponds to \"Jan\", \"Feb\", \"Mar\", etc. And U corresponds to \"January\", \"February\", \"March\", etc. Similar to other name=>value mapping functions dayname and monthname, custom locales can be loaded by passing in the locale=>Dict{String,Int} mapping to the MONTHTOVALUEABBR and MONTHTOVALUE dicts for abbreviated and full-name month names, respectively.One note on parsing performance: using the Date(date_string,format_string) function is fine if only called a few times. If there are many similarly formatted date strings to parse however, it is much more efficient to first create a Dates.DateFormat, and pass it instead of a raw format string.julia> df = DateFormat(\"y-m-d\");\n\njulia> dt = Date(\"2015-01-01\",df)\n2015-01-01\n\njulia> dt2 = Date(\"2015-01-02\",df)\n2015-01-02You can also use the dateformat\"\" string macro. This macro creates the DateFormat object once when the macro is expanded and uses the same DateFormat object even if a code snippet is run multiple times.julia> for i = 1:10^5\n           Date(\"2015-01-01\", dateformat\"y-m-d\")\n       endA full suite of parsing and formatting tests and examples is available in stdlib/Dates/test/io.jl."

    "text": "It\'s good practice when using any language/date framework to be familiar with how date-period arithmetic is handled as there are some tricky issues to deal with (though much less so for day-precision types).The Dates module approach tries to follow the simple principle of trying to change as little as possible when doing Period arithmetic. This approach is also often known as calendrical arithmetic or what you would probably guess if someone were to ask you the same calculation in a conversation. Why all the fuss about this? Let\'s take a classic example: add 1 month to January 31st, 2014. What\'s the answer? Javascript will say March 3 (assumes 31 days). PHP says March 2 (assumes 30 days). The fact is, there is no right answer. In the Dates module, it gives the result of February 28th. How does it figure that out? I like to think of the classic 7-7-7 gambling game in casinos.Now just imagine that instead of 7-7-7, the slots are Year-Month-Day, or in our example, 2014-01-31. When you ask to add 1 month to this date, the month slot is incremented, so now we have 2014-02-31. Then the day number is checked if it is greater than the last valid day of the new month; if it is (as in the case above), the day number is adjusted down to the last valid day (28). What are the ramifications with this approach? Go ahead and add another month to our date, 2014-02-28 + Month(1) == 2014-03-28. What? Were you expecting the last day of March? Nope, sorry, remember the 7-7-7 slots. As few slots as possible are going to change, so we first increment the month slot by 1, 2014-03-28, and boom, we\'re done because that\'s a valid date. On the other hand, if we were to add 2 months to our original date, 2014-01-31, then we end up with 2014-03-31, as expected. The other ramification of this approach is a loss in associativity when a specific ordering is forced (i.e. adding things in different orders results in different outcomes). For example:julia> (Date(2014,1,29)+Dates.Day(1)) + Dates.Month(1)\n2014-02-28\n\njulia> (Date(2014,1,29)+Dates.Month(1)) + Dates.Day(1)\n2014-03-01What\'s going on there? In the first line, we\'re adding 1 day to January 29th, which results in 2014-01-30; then we add 1 month, so we get 2014-02-30, which then adjusts down to 2014-02-28. In the second example, we add 1 month first, where we get 2014-02-29, which adjusts down to 2014-02-28, and then add 1 day, which results in 2014-03-01. One design principle that helps in this case is that, in the presence of multiple Periods, the operations will be ordered by the Periods\' types, not their value or positional order; this means Year will always be added first, then Month, then Week, etc. Hence the following does result in associativity and Just Works:julia> Date(2014,1,29) + Dates.Day(1) + Dates.Month(1)\n2014-03-01\n\njulia> Date(2014,1,29) + Dates.Month(1) + Dates.Day(1)\n2014-03-01Tricky? Perhaps. What is an innocent Dates user to do? The bottom line is to be aware that explicitly forcing a certain associativity, when dealing with months, may lead to some unexpected results, but otherwise, everything should work as expected. Thankfully, that\'s pretty much the extent of the odd cases in date-period arithmetic when dealing with time in UT (avoiding the \"joys\" of dealing with daylight savings, leap seconds, etc.).As a bonus, all period arithmetic objects work directly with ranges:julia> dr = Date(2014,1,29):Day(1):Date(2014,2,3)\n2014-01-29:1 day:2014-02-03\n\njulia> collect(dr)\n6-element Array{Date,1}:\n 2014-01-29\n 2014-01-30\n 2014-01-31\n 2014-02-01\n 2014-02-02\n 2014-02-03\n\njulia> dr = Date(2014,1,29):Dates.Month(1):Date(2014,07,29)\n2014-01-29:1 month:2014-07-29\n\njulia> collect(dr)\n7-element Array{Date,1}:\n 2014-01-29\n 2014-02-28\n 2014-03-29\n 2014-04-29\n 2014-05-29\n 2014-06-29\n 2014-07-29"

    "category": "section",
    "text": "As convenient as date-period arithmetic is, often the kinds of calculations needed on dates take on a calendrical or temporal nature rather than a fixed number of periods. Holidays are a perfect example; most follow rules such as \"Memorial Day = Last Monday of May\", or \"Thanksgiving = 4th Thursday of November\". These kinds of temporal expressions deal with rules relative to the calendar, like first or last of the month, next Tuesday, or the first and third Wednesdays, etc.The Dates module provides the adjuster API through several convenient methods that aid in simply and succinctly expressing temporal rules. The first group of adjuster methods deal with the first and last of weeks, months, quarters, and years. They each take a single TimeType as input and return or adjust to the first or last of the desired period relative to the input.julia> Dates.firstdayofweek(Date(2014,7,16)) # Adjusts the input to the Monday of the input\'s week\n2014-07-14\n\njulia> Dates.lastdayofmonth(Date(2014,7,16)) # Adjusts to the last day of the input\'s month\n2014-07-31\n\njulia> Dates.lastdayofquarter(Date(2014,7,16)) # Adjusts to the last day of the input\'s quarter\n2014-09-30The next two higher-order methods, tonext, and toprev, generalize working with temporal expressions by taking a DateFunction as first argument, along with a starting TimeType. A DateFunction is just a function, usually anonymous, that takes a single TimeType as input and returns a Bool, true indicating a satisfied adjustment criterion. For example:julia> istuesday = x->Dates.dayofweek(x) == Dates.Tuesday; # Returns true if the day of the week of x is Tuesday\n\njulia> Dates.tonext(istuesday, Date(2014,7,13)) # 2014-07-13 is a Sunday\n2014-07-15\n\njulia> Dates.tonext(Date(2014,7,13), Dates.Tuesday) # Convenience method provided for day of the week adjustments\n2014-07-15This is useful with the do-block syntax for more complex temporal expressions:julia> Dates.tonext(Date(2014,7,13)) do x\n           # Return true on the 4th Thursday of November (Thanksgiving)\n           Dates.dayofweek(x) == Dates.Thursday &&\n           Dates.dayofweekofmonth(x) == 4 &&\n           Dates.month(x) == Dates.November\n       end\n2014-11-27The Base.filter method can be used to obtain all valid dates/moments in a specified range:# Pittsburgh street cleaning; Every 2nd Tuesday from April to November\n# Date range from January 1st, 2014 to January 1st, 2015\njulia> dr = Dates.Date(2014):Day(1):Dates.Date(2015);\n\njulia> filter(dr) do x\n           Dates.dayofweek(x) == Dates.Tue &&\n           Dates.April <= Dates.month(x) <= Dates.Nov &&\n           Dates.dayofweekofmonth(x) == 2\n       end\n8-element Array{Date,1}:\n 2014-04-08\n 2014-05-13\n 2014-06-10\n 2014-07-08\n 2014-08-12\n 2014-09-09\n 2014-10-14\n 2014-11-11Additional examples and tests are available in stdlib/Dates/test/adjusters.jl."

But rounding behaviour in cases in which this is not true may lead to confusion.

The reason that 2016-07-17T12:00:00 was chosen is that it is 17,676,660 hours after 0000-01-01T00:00:00, and 17,676,660 is divisible by 10.As Julia Date and DateTime values are represented according to the ISO 8601 standard, 0000-01-01T00:00:00 was chosen as base (or \"rounding epoch\") from which to begin the count of days (and milliseconds) used in rounding calculations. (Note that this differs slightly from Julia\'s internal representation of Date s using Rata Die notation; but since the ISO 8601 standard is most visible to the end user, 0000-01-01T00:00:00 was chosen as the rounding epoch instead of the 0000-12-31T00:00:00 used internally to minimize confusion.)The only exception to the use of 0000-01-01T00:00:00 as the rounding epoch is when rounding to weeks. Rounding to the nearest week will always return a Monday (the first day of the week as specified by ISO 8601). For this reason, we use 0000-01-03T00:00:00 (the first day of the first week of year 0000, as defined by ISO 8601) as the base when rounding to a number of weeks.Here is a related case in which the expected behaviour is not necessarily obvious: What happens when we round to the nearest P(2), where P is a Period type? In some cases (specifically, when P <: Dates.TimePeriod) the answer is clear:julia> round(DateTime(2016, 7, 17, 8, 55, 30), Dates.Hour(2))\n2016-07-17T08:00:00\n\njulia> round(DateTime(2016, 7, 17, 8, 55, 30), Dates.Minute(2))\n2016-07-17T08:56:00This seems obvious, because two of each of these periods still divides evenly into the next larger order period. But in the case of two months (which still divides evenly into one year), the answer may be surprising:julia> round(DateTime(2016, 7, 17, 8, 55, 30), Dates.Month(2))\n2016-07-01T00:00:00Why round to the first day in July, even though it is month 7 (an odd number)? The key is that months are 1-indexed (the first month is assigned 1), unlike hours, minutes, seconds, and milliseconds (the first of which are assigned 0).This means that rounding a DateTime to an even multiple of seconds, minutes, hours, or years (because the ISO 8601 specification includes a year zero) will result in a DateTime with an even value in that field, while rounding a DateTime to an even multiple of months will result in the months field having an odd value. Because both months and years may contain an irregular number of days, whether rounding to an even number of days will result in an even value in the days field is uncertain.See the API reference for additional information on methods exported from the Dates module."

Relevant only when using TCP/IP as transport.\n\n\n\n\n\naddprocs(machines; tunnel=false, sshflags=``, max_parallel=10, kwargs...) -> List of process identifiers\n\nAdd processes on remote machines via SSH.

Workers are started for each specification.\n\nA machine specification is either a string machine_spec or a tuple - (machine_spec, count).\n\nmachine_spec is a string of the form [user@]host[:port] [bind_addr[:port]]. user defaults to current user, port to the standard ssh port. If [bind_addr[:port]] is specified, other workers will connect to this worker at the specified bind_addr and port.\n\ncount is the number of workers to be launched on the specified host. If specified as :auto it will launch as many workers as the number of CPU threads on the specific host.\n\nKeyword arguments:\n\ntunnel: if true then SSH tunneling will be used to connect to the worker from the master process. Default is false.\nsshflags: specifies additional ssh options, e.g. sshflags=`-i /home/foo/bar.pem`\nmax_parallel: specifies the maximum number of workers connected to in parallel at a host. Defaults to 10.\ndir: specifies the working directory on the workers. Defaults to the host\'s current directory (as found by pwd())\nenable_threaded_blas: if true then  BLAS will run on multiple threads in added processes. Default is false.\nexename: name of the julia executable. Defaults to \"$(Sys.BINDIR)/julia\" or \"$(Sys.BINDIR)/julia-debug\" as the case may be.\nexeflags: additional flags passed to the worker processes.\ntopology: Specifies how the workers connect to each other. Sending a message between unconnected workers results in an error.\ntopology=:all_to_all: All processes are connected to each other. The default.\ntopology=:master_worker: Only the driver process, i.e. pid 1 connects to the workers. The workers do not connect to each other.\ntopology=:custom: The launch method of the cluster manager specifies the connection topology via fields ident and connect_idents in WorkerConfig. A worker with a cluster manager identity ident will connect to all workers specified in connect_idents.\nlazy: Applicable only with topology=:all_to_all. If true, worker-worker connections are setup lazily, i.e. they are setup at the first instance of a remote call between workers. Default is true.\n\nEnvironment variables :\n\nIf the master process fails to establish a connection with a newly launched worker within 60.0 seconds, the worker treats it as a fatal situation and terminates. This timeout can be controlled via environment variable JULIA_WORKER_TIMEOUT. The value of JULIA_WORKER_TIMEOUT on the master process specifies the number of seconds a newly launched worker waits for connection establishment.\n\n\n\n\n\naddprocs(; kwargs...) -> List of process identifiers\n\nEquivalent to addprocs(Sys.CPU_THREADS; kwargs...)\n\nNote that workers do not run a .julia/config/startup.jl startup script, nor do they synchronize their global state (such as global variables, new method definitions, and loaded modules) with any of the other running processes.\n\n\n\n\n\naddprocs(np::Integer; restrict=true, kwargs...) -> List of process identifiers\n\nLaunches workers using the in-built LocalManager which only launches workers on the local host. This can be used to take advantage of multiple cores. addprocs(4) will add 4 processes on the local machine. If restrict is true, binding is restricted to 127.0.0.1. Keyword args dir, exename, exeflags, topology, lazy and enable_threaded_blas have the same effect as documented for addprocs(machines).\n\n\n\n\n\n"

To use only the local process and distribute over tasks, specify distributed=false. This is equivalent to using asyncmap. For example, pmap(f, c; distributed=false) is equivalent to asyncmap(f,c; ntasks=()->nworkers())\n\npmap can also use a mix of processes and tasks via the batch_size argument. For batch sizes greater than 1, the collection is processed in multiple batches, each of length batch_size or less. A batch is sent as a single request to a free worker, where a local asyncmap processes elements from the batch using multiple concurrent tasks.\n\nAny error stops pmap from processing the remainder of the collection. To override this behavior you can specify an error handling function via argument on_error which takes in a single argument, i.e., the exception. The function can stop the processing by rethrowing the error, or, to continue, return any value which is then returned inline with the results to the caller.\n\nConsider the following two examples. The first one returns the exception object inline, the second a 0 in place of any exception:\n\njulia> pmap(x->iseven(x) ? error(\"foo\") : x, 1:4; on_error=identity)\n4-element Array{Any,1}:\n 1\n  ErrorException(\"foo\")\n 3\n  ErrorException(\"foo\")\n\njulia> pmap(x->iseven(x) ? error(\"foo\") : x, 1:4; on_error=ex->0)\n4-element Array{Int64,1}:\n 1\n 0\n 3\n 0\n\nErrors can also be handled by retrying failed computations. Keyword arguments retry_delays and retry_check are passed through to retry as keyword arguments delays and check respectively. If batching is specified, and an entire batch fails, all items in the batch are retried.\n\nNote that if both on_error and retry_delays are specified, the on_error hook is called before retrying. If on_error does not throw (or rethrow) an exception, the element will not be retried.\n\nExample: On errors, retry f on an element a maximum of 3 times without any delay between retries.\n\npmap(f, c; retry_delays = zeros(3))\n\nExample: Retry f only if the exception is not of type InexactError, with exponentially increasing delays up to 3 times. Return a NaN in place for all InexactError occurrences.\n\npmap(f, c; on_error = e->(isa(e, InexactError) ? NaN : rethrow(e)), retry_delays = ExponentialBackOff(n = 3))\n\n\n\n\n\n"

See the documentation on factorize for more information. As an example:julia> A = [1.5 2 -4; 3 -1 -6; -10 2.3 4]\n3×3 Array{Float64,2}:\n   1.5   2.0  -4.0\n   3.0  -1.0  -6.0\n -10.0   2.3   4.0\n\njulia> factorize(A)\nLU{Float64,Array{Float64,2}}\nL factor:\n3×3 Array{Float64,2}:\n  1.0    0.0       0.0\n -0.15   1.0       0.0\n -0.3   -0.132196  1.0\nU factor:\n3×3 Array{Float64,2}:\n -10.0  2.3     4.0\n   0.0  2.345  -3.4\n   0.0  0.0    -5.24947Since A is not Hermitian, symmetric, triangular, tridiagonal, or bidiagonal, an LU factorization may be the best we can do.

Often it\'s possible to write more efficient code for a matrix that is known to have certain properties e.g. it is symmetric, or tridiagonal. Julia provides some special types so that you can \"tag\" matrices as having these properties. For instance:julia> B = [1.5 2 -4; 2 -1 -3; -4 -3 5]\n3×3 Array{Float64,2}:\n  1.5   2.0  -4.0\n  2.0  -1.0  -3.0\n -4.0  -3.0   5.0\n\njulia> sB = Symmetric(B)\n3×3 Symmetric{Float64,Array{Float64,2}}:\n  1.5   2.0  -4.0\n  2.0  -1.0  -3.0\n -4.0  -3.0   5.0sB has been tagged as a matrix that\'s (real) symmetric, so for later operations we might perform on it, such as eigenfactorization or computing matrix-vector products, efficiencies can be found by only referencing half of it. For example:julia> B = [1.5 2 -4; 2 -1 -3; -4 -3 5]\n3×3 Array{Float64,2}:\n  1.5   2.0  -4.0\n  2.0  -1.0  -3.0\n -4.0  -3.0   5.0\n\njulia> sB = Symmetric(B)\n3×3 Symmetric{Float64,Array{Float64,2}}:\n  1.5   2.0  -4.0\n  2.0  -1.0  -3.0\n -4.0  -3.0   5.0\n\njulia> x = [1; 2; 3]\n3-element Array{Int64,1}:\n 1\n 2\n 3\n\njulia> sB\\x\n3-element Array{Float64,1}:\n -1.7391304347826084\n -1.1086956521739126\n -1.4565217391304346The \\ operation here performs the linear solution. The left-division operator is pretty powerful and it\'s easy to write compact, readable code that is flexible enough to solve all sorts of systems of linear equations."

If A is a matrix and p=2, then this is equivalent to the Frobenius norm.\n\nThe second argument p is not necessarily a part of the interface for norm, i.e. a custom type may only implement norm(A) without second argument.\n\nUse opnorm to compute the operator norm of a matrix.\n\nExamples\n\njulia> v = [3, -2, 6]\n3-element Array{Int64,1}:\n  3\n -2\n  6\n\njulia> norm(v)\n7.0\n\njulia> norm(v, 1)\n11.0\n\njulia> norm(v, Inf)\n6.0\n\njulia> norm([1 2 3; 4 5 6; 7 8 9])\n16.881943016134134\n\njulia> norm([1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9])\n16.881943016134134\n\njulia> norm(1:9)\n16.881943016134134\n\njulia> norm(hcat(v,v), 1) == norm(vcat(v,v), 1) != norm([v,v], 1)\ntrue\n\njulia> norm(hcat(v,v), 2) == norm(vcat(v,v), 2) == norm([v,v], 2)\ntrue\n\njulia> norm(hcat(v,v), Inf) == norm(vcat(v,v), Inf) != norm([v,v], Inf)\ntrue\n\n\n\n\n\nnorm(x::Number, p::Real=2)\n\nFor numbers, return left( x^p right)^1p.\n\nExamples\n\njulia> norm(2, 1)\n2\n\njulia> norm(-2, 1)\n2\n\njulia> norm(2, 2)\n2\n\njulia> norm(-2, 2)\n2\n\njulia> norm(2, Inf)\n2\n\njulia> norm(-2, Inf)\n2\n\n\n\n\n\n"

There are highly optimized implementations of BLAS available for every computer architecture, and sometimes in high-performance linear algebra routines it is useful to call the BLAS functions directly.LinearAlgebra.BLAS provides wrappers for some of the BLAS functions. Those BLAS functions that overwrite one of the input arrays have names ending in \'!\'.  Usually, a BLAS function has four methods defined, for Float64, Float32, ComplexF64, and ComplexF32 arrays."

Events are created by inserting a logging statement into the source code, for example:@warn \"Abandon printf debugging, all ye who enter here!\"\n┌ Warning: Abandon printf debugging, all ye who enter here!\n└ @ Main REPL[1]:1The system provides several advantages over peppering your source code with calls to println().  First, it allows you to control the visibility and presentation of messages without editing the source code.  For example, in contrast to the @warn above@debug \"The sum of some values $(sum(rand(100)))\"will produce no output by default.  Furthermore, it\'s very cheap to leave debug statements like this in the source code because the system avoids evaluating the message if it would later be ignored.  In this case sum(rand(100)) and the associated string processing will never be executed unless debug logging is enabled.Second, the logging tools allow you to attach arbitrary data to each event as a set of key–value pairs. This allows you to capture local variables and other program state for later analysis. For example, to attach the local array variable A and the sum of a vector v as the key s you can useA = ones(Int, 4, 4)\nv = ones(100)\n@info \"Some variables\"  A  s=sum(v)\n\n# output\n┌ Info: Some variables\n│   A =\n│    4×4 Array{Int64,2}:\n│     1  1  1  1\n│     1  1  1  1\n│     1  1  1  1\n│     1  1  1  1\n└   s = 100.0All of the logging macros @debug, @info, @warn and @error share common features that are described in detail in the documentation for the more general macro @logmsg."

Let\'s examine the user-defined data first:The log level is a broad category for the message that is used for early filtering. There are several standard levels of type LogLevel; user-defined levels are also possible.\nUse Debug for verbose information that could be useful when debugging an application or module. These events are disabled by default.\nUse Info to inform the user about the normal operation of the program.\nUse Warn when a potential problem is detected.\nUse Error to report errors where the code has enough context to recover and continue.  (When the code doesn\'t have enough context, an exception or early return is more appropriate.)\nThe message  is an object describing the event. By convention AbstractStrings passed as messages are assumed to be in markdown format. Other types will be displayed using show(io,mime,obj) according to the display capabilities of the installed logger.\nOptional key–value pairs allow arbitrary data to be attached to each event. Some keys have conventional meaning that can affect the way an event is interpreted (see @logmsg).The system also generates some standard information for each event:The module in which the logging macro was expanded.\nThe file and line where the logging macro occurs in the source code.\nA message id that is unique for each logging macro invocation. This is very useful as a key for caching information or actions associated with an event. For instance, it can be used to limit the number of times a message is presented to the user.\nA group for the event, which is set to the base name of the file by default, without extension.  This can be used to group messages into categories more finely than the log level (for example, all deprecation warnings have group :depwarn), or into logical groupings across or within modules.Notice that some useful information such as the event time is not included by default. This is because such information can be expensive to extract and is also dynamically available to the current logger. It\'s simple to define a custom logger to augment event data with the time, backtrace, values of global variables and other useful information as required."

This is a key design feature that makes the system composable and natural for concurrent use. It does this by separating two different concerns:Creating log events is the concern of the module author who needs to decide where events are triggered and which information to include.\nProcessing of log events — that is, display, filtering, aggregation and recording — is the concern of the application author who needs to bring multiple modules together into a cooperating application."

    "text": "Processing of events is performed by a logger, which is the first piece of user configurable code to see the event. All loggers must be subtypes of AbstractLogger.When an event is triggered, the appropriate logger is found by looking for a task-local logger with the global logger as fallback.  The idea here is that the application code knows how log events should be processed and exists somewhere at the top of the call stack. So we should look up through the call stack to discover the logger — that is, the logger should be dynamically scoped. (This is a point of contrast with logging frameworks where the logger is lexically scoped; provided explicitly by the module author or as a simple global variable. In such a system it\'s awkward to control logging while composing functionality from multiple modules.)The global logger may be set with global_logger, and task-local loggers controlled using with_logger.  Newly spawned tasks inherit the logger of the parent task.There are three logger types provided by the library.  ConsoleLogger is the default logger you see when starting the REPL.  It displays events in a readable text format and tries to give simple but user friendly control over formatting and filtering.  NullLogger is a convenient way to drop all messages where necessary; it is the logging equivalent of the devnull stream.  SimpleLogger is a very simplistic text formatting logger, mainly useful for debugging the logging system itself.Custom loggers should come with overloads for the functions described in the reference section."

This is a crude but extremely cheap global setting.\nThe current logger state is looked up and the message level checked against the logger\'s cached minimum level, as found by calling Logging.min_enabled_level. This behavior can be overridden via environment variables (more on this later).\nThe Logging.shouldlog function is called with the current logger, taking some minimal information (level, module, group, id) which can be computed statically.  Most usefully, shouldlog is passed an event id which can be used to discard events early based on a cached predicate.If all these checks pass, the message and key–value pairs are evaluated in full and passed to the current logger via the Logging.handle_message function. handle_message() may perform additional filtering as required and display the event to the screen, save it to a file, etc.Exceptions that occur while generating the log event are captured and logged by default.  This prevents individual broken events from crashing the application, which is helpful when enabling little-used debug events in a production system.  This behavior can be customized per logger type by extending Logging.catch_exceptions."

For convenience, four logging macros @debug, @info, @warn and @error are defined which log at the standard severity levels Debug, Info, Warn and Error.  @logmsg allows level to be set programmatically to any LogLevel or custom log level types.\n\nmessage should be an expression which evaluates to a string which is a human readable description of the log event.  By convention, this string will be formatted as markdown when presented.\n\nThe optional list of key=value pairs supports arbitrary user defined metadata which will be passed through to the logging backend as part of the log record.  If only a value expression is supplied, a key representing the expression will be generated using Symbol. For example, x becomes x=x, and foo(10) becomes Symbol(\"foo(10)\")=foo(10).  For splatting a list of key value pairs, use the normal splatting syntax, @info \"blah\" kws....\n\nThere are some keys which allow automatically generated log data to be overridden:\n\n_module=mod can be used to specify a different originating module from the source location of the message.\n_group=symbol can be used to override the message group (this is normally derived from the base name of the source file).\n_id=symbol can be used to override the automatically generated unique message identifier.

This provides a convenient way of working with data too large to fit in the computer\'s memory.\n\nThe type is an Array{T,N} with a bits-type element of T and dimension N that determines how the bytes of the array are interpreted. Note that the file must be stored in binary format, and no format conversions are possible (this is a limitation of operating systems, not Julia).\n\ndims is a tuple or single Integer specifying the size or length of the array.\n\nThe file is passed via the stream argument, either as an open IOStream or filename string. When you initialize the stream, use \"r\" for a \"read-only\" array, and \"w+\" to create a new array used to write values to disk.\n\nIf no type argument is specified, the default is Vector{UInt8}.\n\nOptionally, you can specify an offset (in bytes) if, for example, you want to skip over a header in the file. The default value for the offset is the current stream position for an IOStream.\n\nThe grow keyword argument specifies whether the disk file should be grown to accommodate the requested size of array (if the total file size is < requested array size). Write privileges are required to grow the file.\n\nThe shared keyword argument specifies whether the resulting Array and changes made to it will be visible to other processes mapping the same file.\n\nFor example, the following code\n\n# Create a file for mmapping\n# (you could alternatively use mmap to do this step, too)\nA = rand(1:20, 5, 30)\ns = open(\"/tmp/mmap.bin\", \"w+\")\n# We\'ll write the dimensions of the array as the first two Ints in the file\nwrite(s, size(A,1))\nwrite(s, size(A,2))\n# Now write the data\nwrite(s, A)\nclose(s)\n\n# Test by reading it back in\ns = open(\"/tmp/mmap.bin\")   # default is read-only\nm = read(s, Int)\nn = read(s, Int)\nA2 = Mmap.mmap(s, Matrix{Int}, (m,n))\n\ncreates a m-by-n Matrix{Int}, linked to the file associated with stream s.\n\nA more portable file would need to encode the word size – 32 bit or 64 bit – and endianness information in the header. In practice, consider encoding binary data using standard formats like HDF5 (which can be used with memory-mapping).\n\n\n\n\n\nMmap.mmap(io, BitArray, [dims, offset])\n\nCreate a BitArray whose values are linked to a file, using memory-mapping; it has the same purpose, works in the same way, and has the same arguments, as mmap, but the byte representation is different.\n\nExamples\n\njulia> io = open(\"mmap.bin\", \"w+\");\n\njulia> B = Mmap.mmap(io, BitArray, (25,30000));\n\njulia> B[3, 4000] = true;\n\njulia> Mmap.sync!(B);\n\njulia> close(io);\n\njulia> io = open(\"mmap.bin\", \"r+\");\n\njulia> C = Mmap.mmap(io, BitArray, (25,30000));\n\njulia> C[3, 4000]\ntrue\n\njulia> C[2, 4000]\nfalse\n\njulia> close(io)\n\njulia> rm(\"mmap.bin\")\n\nThis creates a 25-by-30000 BitArray, linked to the file associated with stream io.\n\n\n\n\n\n"

    "text": "Pkg is the standard package manager for Julia 1.0 and newer. Unlike traditional package managers, which install and manage a single global set of packages, Pkg is designed around “environments”: independent sets of packages that can be local to an individual project or shared and selected by name. The exact set of packages and versions in an environment is captured in a manifest file which can be checked into a project repository and tracked in version control, significantly improving reproducibility of projects. If you’ve ever tried to run code you haven’t used in a while only to find that you can’t get anything to work because you’ve updated or uninstalled some of the packages your project was using, you’ll understand the motivation for this approach. In Pkg, since each project maintains its own independent set of package versions, you’ll never have this problem again. Moreover, if you check out a project on a new system, you can simply materialize the environment described by its manifest file and immediately be up and running with a known-good set of dependencies.Since environments are managed and updated independently from each other, “dependency hell” is significantly alleviated in Pkg. If you want to use the latest and greatest version of some package in a new project but you’re stuck on an older version in a different project, that’s no problem – since they have separate environments they can just use different versions, which are both installed at the same time in different locations on your system. The location of each package version is canonical, so when environments use the same versions of packages, they can share installations, avoiding unnecessary duplication of the package. Old package versions that are no longer used by any environments are periodically “garbage collected” by the package manager.Pkg’s approach to local environments may be familiar to people who have used Python’s virtualenv or Ruby’s bundler. In Julia, instead of hacking the language’s code loading mechanisms to support environments, we have the benefit that Julia natively understands them. In addition, Julia environments are “stackable”: you can overlay one environment with another and thereby have access to additional packages outside of the primary environment. This makes it easy to work on a project, which provides the primary environment, while still having access to all your usual dev tools like profilers, debuggers, and so on, just by having an environment including these dev tools later in the load path.Last but not least, Pkg is designed to support federated package registries. This means that it allows multiple registries managed by different parties to interact seamlessly. In particular, this includes private registries which can live behind corporate firewalls. You can install and update your own packages from a private registry with exactly the same tools and workflows that you use to install and manage official Julia packages. If you urgently need to apply a hotfix for a public package that’s critical to your company’s product, you can tag a private version of it in your company’s internal registry and get a fix to your developers and ops teams quickly and easily without having to wait for an upstream patch to be accepted and published. Once an official fix is published, however, you can just upgrade your dependencies and you\'ll be back on an official release again."

    "text": "Project: a source tree with a standard layout, including a src directory for the main body of Julia code, a test directory for testing the project, docs for documentation files, and optionally a deps directory for a build script and its outputs. A project will typically also have a project file and may optionally have a manifest file:Project file: a file in the root directory of a project, named Project.toml (or JuliaProject.toml) describing metadata about the project, including its name, UUID (for packages), authors, license, and the names and UUIDs of packages and libraries that it depends on.\nManifest file: a file in the root directory of a project, named Manifest.toml (or JuliaManifest.toml) describing a complete dependency graph and exact versions of each package and library used by a project.Package: a project which provides reusable functionality that can be used by other Julia projects via import X or using X. A package should have a project file with a uuid entry giving its package UUID. This UUID is used to identify the package in projects that depend on it.note: Note\nFor legacy reasons it is possible to load a package without a project file or UUID from the REPL or the top-level of a script. It is not possible, however, to load a package without a project file or UUID from a project with them. Once you\'ve loaded from a project file, everything needs a project file and UUID.Application: a project which provides standalone functionality not intended to be reused by other Julia projects. For example a web application or a commmand-line utility, or simulation/analytics code accompanying a scientific paper. An application may have a UUID but does not need one. An application may also provide global configuration options for packages it depends on. Packages, on the other hand, may not provide global configuration since that could conflict with the configuration of the main application.note: Note\nProjects vs. Packages vs. Applications:Project is an umbrella term: packages and applications are kinds of projects.\nPackages should have UUIDs, applications can have a UUIDs but don\'t need them.\nApplications can provide global configuration, whereas packages cannot.Library (future work): a compiled binary dependency (not written in Julia) packaged to be used by a Julia project. These are currently typically built in- place by a deps/build.jl script in a project’s source tree, but in the future we plan to make libraries first-class entities directly installed and upgraded by the package manager.Environment: the combination of the top-level name map provided by a project file combined with the dependency graph and map from packages to their entry points provided by a manifest file. For more detail see the manual section on code loading.Explicit environment: an environment in the form of an explicit project file and an optional corresponding manifest file together in a directory. If the manifest file is absent then the implied dependency graph and location maps are empty.\nImplicit environment: an environment provided as a directory (without a project file or manifest file) containing packages with entry points of the form X.jl, X.jl/src/X.jl or X/src/X.jl. The top-level name map is implied by these entry points. The dependency graph is implied by the existence of project files inside of these package directories, e.g. X.jl/Project.toml or X/Project.toml. The dependencies of the X package are the dependencies in the corresponding project file if there is one. The location map is implied by the entry points themselves.Registry: a source tree with a standard layout recording metadata about a registered set of packages, the tagged versions of them which are available, and which versions of packages are compatible or incompatible with each other. A registry is indexed by package name and UUID, and has a directory for each registered package providing the following metadata about it:name – e.g. DataFrames\nUUID – e.g. a93c6f00-e57d-5684-b7b6-d8193f3e46c0\nauthors – e.g. Jane Q. Developer <jane@example.com>\nlicense – e.g. MIT, BSD3, or GPLv2\nrepository – e.g. https://github.com/JuliaData/DataFrames.jl.git\ndescription – a block of text summarizing the functionality of a package\nkeywords – e.g. data, tabular, analysis, statistics\nversions – a list of all registered version tagsFor each registered version of a package, the following information is provided:its semantic version number – e.g. v1.2.3\nits git tree SHA-1 hash – e.g. 7ffb18ea3245ef98e368b02b81e8a86543a11103\na map from names to UUIDs of dependencies\nwhich versions of other packages it is compatible/incompatible withDependencies and compatibility are stored in a compressed but human-readable format using ranges of package versions.Depot: a directory on a system where various package-related resources live, including:environments: shared named environments (e.g. v0.7, devtools)\nclones: bare clones of package repositories\ncompiled: cached compiled package images (.ji files)\nconfig: global configuration files (e.g. startup.jl)\ndev: default directory for package development\nlogs: log files (e.g. manifest_usage.toml, repl_history.jl)\npackages: installed package versions\nregistries: clones of registries (e.g. General)Load path: a stack of environments where package identities, their dependencies, and entry-points are searched for. The load path is controlled in Julia by the LOAD_PATH global variable which is populated at startup based on the value of the JULIA_LOAD_PATH environment variable. The first entry is your primary environment, often the current project, while later entries provide additional packages one may want to use from the REPL or top-level scripts.Depot path: a stack of depot locations where the package manager, as well as Julia\'s code loading mechanisms, look for registries, installed packages, named environments, repo clones, cached compiled package images, and configuration files. The depot path is controlled by the Julia DEPOT_PATH global variable which is populated at startup based on the value of the JULIA_DEPOT_PATH environment variable. The first entry is the “user depot” and should be writable by and owned by the current user. The user depot is where: registries are cloned, new package versions are installed, named environments are created and updated, package repos are cloned, newly compiled package image files are saved, log files are written, development packages are checked out by default, and global configuration data is saved. Later entries in the depot path are treated as read-only and are appropriate for registries, packages, etc. installed and managed by system administrators."

This has the advantage that you can send your project (Project.toml and Manifest.toml) to someone else and they can \"instantiate\" that project in the same state as you had it locally. However, when you are developing a package, it is more convenient to load packages at their current state at some path. For this reason, the dev command exists.Let\'s try to dev a registered package:(v0.7) pkg> dev Example\n  Updating git-repo `https://github.com/JuliaLang/Example.jl.git`\n Resolving package versions...\n  Updating `~/.julia/environments/v0.7/Project.toml`\n  [7876af07] + Example v0.5.1+ [`~/.julia/dev/Example`]\n  Updating `~/.julia/environments/v0.7/Manifest.toml`\n  [7876af07] + Example v0.5.1+ [`~/.julia/dev/Example`]The dev command fetches a full clone of the package to ~/.julia/dev/ (the path can be changed by setting the environment variable JULIA_PKG_DEVDIR). When importing Example julia will now import it from ~/.julia/dev/Example and whatever local changes have been made to the files in that path are consequently reflected in the code loaded. When we used add we said that we tracked the package repository, we here say that we track the path itself. Note that the package manager will never touch any of the files at a tracked path. It is therefore up to you to pull updates, change branches etc. If we try to dev a package at some branch that already exists at ~/.julia/dev/ the package manager we will simply use the existing path. For example:(v0.7) pkg> dev Example\n  Updating git-repo `https://github.com/JuliaLang/Example.jl.git`\n[ Info: Path `/Users/kristoffer/.julia/dev/Example` exists and looks like the correct package, using existing path instead of cloningNote the info message saying that it is using the existing path. As a general rule, the package manager will never touch files that are tracking a path.If dev is used on a local path, that path to that package is recorded and used when loading that package. The path will be recorded relative to the project file, unless it is given as an absolute path.To stop tracking a path and use the registered version again, use free(v0.7) pkg> free Example\n Resolving package versions...\n  Updating `~/.julia/environments/v0.7/Project.toml`\n  [7876af07] ↓ Example v0.5.1+ [`~/.julia/dev/Example`] ⇒ v0.5.1\n  Updating `~/.julia/environments/v0.7/Manifest.toml`\n  [7876af07] ↓ Example v0.5.1+ [`~/.julia/dev/Example`] ⇒ v0.5.1It should be pointed out that by using dev your project is now inherently stateful. Its state depends on the current content of the files at the path and the manifest cannot be \"instantiated\" by someone else without knowing the exact content of all the packages that are tracking a path.Note that if you add a dependency to a package that tracks a local path, the Manifest (which contains the whole dependency graph) will become out of sync with the actual dependency graph. This means that the package will not be able to load that dependency since it is not recorded in the Manifest. To update sync the Manifest, use the REPL command resolve."

    "text": "DocTestSetup = :(using Random)Random number generation in Julia uses the Mersenne Twister library via MersenneTwister objects. Julia has a global RNG, which is used by default. Other RNG types can be plugged in by inheriting the AbstractRNG type; they can then be used to have multiple streams of random numbers. Besides MersenneTwister, Julia also provides the RandomDevice RNG type, which is a wrapper over the OS provided entropy.Most functions related to random generation accept an optional AbstractRNG object as first argument, which defaults to the global one if not provided. Moreover, some of them accept optionally dimension specifications dims... (which can be given as a tuple) to generate arrays of random values.A MersenneTwister or RandomDevice RNG can generate uniformly random numbers of the following types: Float16, Float32, Float64, BigFloat, Bool, Int8, UInt8, Int16, UInt16, Int32, UInt32, Int64, UInt64, Int128, UInt128, BigInt (or complex numbers of those types). Random floating point numbers are generated uniformly in 0 1). As BigInt represents unbounded integers, the interval must be specified (e.g. rand(big.(1:6))).Additionally, normal and exponential distributions are implemented for some AbstractFloat and Complex types, see randn and randexp for details."

Assume that rand(rng, 1:20) has to be called repeatedly in a loop: the way to take advantage of this decoupling is as follows:rng = MersenneTwister()\nsp = Random.Sampler(rng, 1:20) # or Random.Sampler(MersenneTwister,1:20)\nfor x in X\n    n = rand(rng, sp) # similar to n = rand(rng, 1:20)\n    # use n\nendThis mechanism is of course used by the default implementation of random array generation (like in rand(1:20, 10)). In order to implement this decoupling for a custom type, a helper type can be used. Going back to our Die example: rand(::Die) uses random generation from a range, so there is an opportunity for this optimization:import Random: Sampler, rand\n\nstruct SamplerDie <: Sampler{Int} # generates values of type Int\n    die::Die\n    sp::Sampler{Int} # this is an abstract type, so this could be improved\nend\n\nSampler(RNG::Type{<:AbstractRNG}, die::Die, r::Random.Repetition) =\n    SamplerDie(die, Sampler(RNG, 1:die.nsides, r))\n# the `r` parameter will be explained later on\n\nrand(rng::AbstractRNG, sp::SamplerDie) = rand(rng, sp.sp)It\'s now possible to get a sampler with sp = Sampler(rng, die), and use sp instead of die in any rand call involving rng. In the simplistic example above, die doesn\'t need to be stored in SamplerDie but this is often the case in practice.This pattern is so frequent that a helper type named Random.SamplerSimple is available, saving us the definition of SamplerDie: we could have implemented our decoupling with:Sampler(RNG::Type{<:AbstractRNG}, die::Die, r::Random.Repetition) =\n    SamplerSimple(die, Sampler(RNG, 1:die.nsides, r))\n\nrand(rng::AbstractRNG, sp::SamplerSimple{Die}) = rand(rng, sp.data)Here, sp.data refers to the second parameter in the call to the SamplerSimple constructor (in this case equal to Sampler(rng, 1:die.nsides, r)), while the Die object can be accessed via sp[].Another helper type is currently available for other cases, Random.SamplerTag, but is considered as internal API, and can break at any time without proper deprecations."

    "text": "In some cases, whether one wants to generate only a handful of values or a large number of values will have an impact on the choice of algorithm. This is handled with the third parameter of the Sampler constructor. Let\'s assume we defined two helper types for Die, say SamplerDie1 which should be used to generate only few random values, and SamplerDieMany for many values. We can use those types as follows:Sampler(RNG::Type{<:AbstractRNG}, die::Die, ::Val{1}) = SamplerDie1(...)\nSampler(RNG::Type{<:AbstractRNG}, die::Die, ::Val{Inf}) = SamplerDieMany(...)Of course, rand must also be defined on those types (i.e. rand(::AbstractRNG, ::SamplerDie1) and rand(::AbstractRNG, ::SamplerDieMany)).Note: Sampler(rng, x) is simply a shorthand for Sampler(rng, x, Val(Inf)), and Random.Repetition is an alias for Union{Val{1}, Val{Inf}}."

It would then be possible to skip step 1) in practice (if one wants to specialize generation for this particular RNG type), but the corresponding SamplerS type is considered as internal detail, and may be changed without warning."

    "text": "In Julia, sparse matrices are stored in the Compressed Sparse Column (CSC) format. Julia sparse matrices have the type SparseMatrixCSC{Tv,Ti}, where Tv is the type of the stored values, and Ti is the integer type for storing column pointers and row indices. The internal representation of SparseMatrixCSC is as follows:struct SparseMatrixCSC{Tv,Ti<:Integer} <: AbstractSparseMatrix{Tv,Ti}\n    m::Int                  # Number of rows\n    n::Int                  # Number of columns\n    colptr::Vector{Ti}      # Column i is in colptr[i]:(colptr[i+1]-1)\n    rowval::Vector{Ti}      # Row indices of stored values\n    nzval::Vector{Tv}       # Stored values, typically nonzeros\nendThe compressed sparse column storage makes it easy and quick to access the elements in the column of a sparse matrix, whereas accessing the sparse matrix by rows is considerably slower. Operations such as insertion of previously unstored entries one at a time in the CSC structure tend to be slow. This is because all elements of the sparse matrix that are beyond the point of insertion have to be moved one place over.All operations on sparse matrices are carefully implemented to exploit the CSC data structure for performance, and to avoid expensive operations.If you have data in CSC format from a different application or library, and wish to import it in Julia, make sure that you use 1-based indexing. The row indices in every column need to be sorted. If your SparseMatrixCSC object contains unsorted row indices, one quick way to sort them is by doing a double transpose.In some applications, it is convenient to store explicit zero values in a SparseMatrixCSC. These are accepted by functions in Base (but there is no guarantee that they will be preserved in mutating operations). Such explicitly stored zeros are treated as structural nonzeros by many routines. The nnz function returns the number of elements explicitly stored in the sparse data structure, including structural nonzeros. In order to count the exact number of numerical nonzeros, use count(!iszero, x), which inspects every stored element of a sparse matrix. dropzeros, and the in-place dropzeros!, can be used to remove stored zeros from the sparse matrix.julia> A = sparse([1, 2, 3], [1, 2, 3], [0, 2, 0])\n3×3 SparseMatrixCSC{Int64,Int64} with 3 stored entries:\n  [1, 1]  =  0\n  [2, 2]  =  2\n  [3, 3]  =  0\n\njulia> dropzeros(A)\n3×3 SparseMatrixCSC{Int64,Int64} with 1 stored entry:\n  [2, 2]  =  2"

For example, to construct a sparse matrix we can input a vector I of row indices, a vector J of column indices, and a vector V of stored values (this is also known as the COO (coordinate) format). sparse(I,J,V) then constructs a sparse matrix such that S[I[k], J[k]] = V[k]. The equivalent sparse vector constructor is sparsevec, which takes the (row) index vector I and the vector V with the stored values and constructs a sparse vector R such that R[I[k]] = V[k].julia> I = [1, 4, 3, 5]; J = [4, 7, 18, 9]; V = [1, 2, -5, 3];\n\njulia> S = sparse(I,J,V)\n5×18 SparseMatrixCSC{Int64,Int64} with 4 stored entries:\n  [1 ,  4]  =  1\n  [4 ,  7]  =  2\n  [5 ,  9]  =  3\n  [3 , 18]  =  -5\n\njulia> R = sparsevec(I,V)\n5-element SparseVector{Int64,Int64} with 4 stored entries:\n  [1]  =  1\n  [3]  =  -5\n  [4]  =  2\n  [5]  =  3The inverse of the sparse and sparsevec functions is findnz, which retrieves the inputs used to create the sparse array. findall(!iszero, x) returns the cartesian indices of non-zero entries in x (including stored entries equal to zero).julia> findnz(S)\n([1, 4, 5, 3], [4, 7, 9, 18], [1, 2, 3, -5])\n\njulia> findall(!iszero, S)\n4-element Array{CartesianIndex{2},1}:\n CartesianIndex(1, 4)\n CartesianIndex(4, 7)\n CartesianIndex(5, 9)\n CartesianIndex(3, 18)\n\njulia> findnz(R)\n([1, 3, 4, 5], [1, -5, 2, 3])\n\njulia> findall(!iszero, R)\n4-element Array{Int64,1}:\n 1\n 3\n 4\n 5Another way to create a sparse array is to convert a dense array into a sparse array using the sparse function:julia> sparse(Matrix(1.0I, 5, 5))\n5×5 SparseMatrixCSC{Float64,Int64} with 5 stored entries:\n  [1, 1]  =  1.0\n  [2, 2]  =  1.0\n  [3, 3]  =  1.0\n  [4, 4]  =  1.0\n  [5, 5]  =  1.0\n\njulia> sparse([1.0, 0.0, 1.0])\n3-element SparseVector{Float64,Int64} with 2 stored entries:\n  [1]  =  1.0\n  [3]  =  1.0You can go in the other direction using the Array constructor.

In the event a test fails, the default behavior is to throw an exception immediately. However, it is normally preferable to run the rest of the tests first to get a better picture of how many errors there are in the code being tested.The @testset macro can be used to group tests into sets. All the tests in a test set will be run, and at the end of the test set a summary will be printed. If any of the tests failed, or could not be evaluated due to an error, the test set will then throw a TestSetException.Test.@testsetWe can put our tests for the foo(x) function in a test set:julia> @testset \"Foo Tests\" begin\n           @test foo(\"a\")   == 1\n           @test foo(\"ab\")  == 4\n           @test foo(\"abc\") == 9\n       end;\nTest Summary: | Pass  Total\nFoo Tests     |    3      3Test sets can also be nested:julia> @testset \"Foo Tests\" begin\n           @testset \"Animals\" begin\n               @test foo(\"cat\") == 9\n               @test foo(\"dog\") == foo(\"cat\")\n           end\n           @testset \"Arrays $i\" for i in 1:3\n               @test foo(zeros(i)) == i^2\n               @test foo(fill(1.0, i)) == i^2\n           end\n       end;\nTest Summary: | Pass  Total\nFoo Tests     |    8      8In the event that a nested test set has no failures, as happened here, it will be hidden in the summary.

A different number of tuple elements may be used to match other log metadata, corresponding to the arguments to passed to AbstractLogger via the handle_message function: (level,message,module,group,id,file,line). Elements which are present will be matched pairwise with the log record fields using == by default, with the special cases that Symbols may be used for the standard log levels, and Regexs in the pattern will match string or Symbol fields using occursin.\n\nExamples\n\nConsider a function which logs a warning, and several debug messages:\n\nfunction foo(n)\n    @info \"Doing foo with n=$n\"\n    for i=1:n\n        @debug \"Iteration $i\"\n    end\n    42\nend\n\nWe can test the info message using\n\n@test_logs (:info,\"Doing foo with n=2\") foo(2)\n\nIf we also wanted to test the debug messages, these need to be enabled with the min_level keyword:\n\n@test_logs (:info,\"Doing foo with n=2\") (:debug,\"Iteration 1\") (:debug,\"Iteration 2\") min_level=Debug foo(2)\n\nThe macro may be chained with @test to also test the returned value:\n\n@test (@test_logs (:info,\"Doing foo with n=2\") foo(2)) == 42\n\n\n\n\n\n"

While almost every part of a surface AST is represented by an Expr, the IR uses only a limited number of Exprs, mostly for calls, conditional branches (gotoifnot), and returns.\nSlot\nIdentifies arguments and local variables by consecutive numbering. Slot is an abstract type with subtypes SlotNumber and TypedSlot. Both types have an integer-valued id field giving the slot index. Most slots have the same type at all uses, and so are represented with SlotNumber. The types of these slots are found in the slottypes field of their MethodInstance object. Slots that require per-use type annotations are represented with TypedSlot, which has a typ field.\nCodeInfo\nWraps the IR of a method. Its code field is an array of expressions to execute.\nGotoNode\nUnconditional branch. The argument is the branch target, represented as an index in the code array to jump to.\nQuoteNode\nWraps an arbitrary value to reference as data. For example, the function f() = :a contains a QuoteNode whose value field is the symbol a, in order to return the symbol itself instead of evaluating it.\nGlobalRef\nRefers to global variable name in module mod.\nSSAValue\nRefers to a consecutively-numbered (starting at 1) static single assignment (SSA) variable inserted by the compiler. The number (id) of an SSAValue is the code array index of the expression whose value it represents.\nNewvarNode\nMarks a point where a variable (slot) is created.

In the IR, the first argument is always a Slot or a GlobalRef.\nmethod\nAdds a method to a generic function and assigns the result if necessary.\nHas a 1-argument form and a 4-argument form. The 1-argument form arises from the syntax function foo end. In the 1-argument form, the argument is a symbol. If this symbol already names a function in the current scope, nothing happens. If the symbol is undefined, a new function is created and assigned to the identifier specified by the symbol. If the symbol is defined but names a non-function, an error is raised. The definition of \"names a function\" is that the binding is constant, and refers to an object of singleton type. The rationale for this is that an instance of a singleton type uniquely identifies the type to add the method to. When the type has fields, it wouldn\'t be clear whether the method was being added to the instance or its type.\nThe 4-argument form has the following arguments:\nargs[1]\nA function name, or false if unknown. If a symbol, then the expression first behaves like the 1-argument form above. This argument is ignored from then on. When this is false, it means a method is being added strictly by type, (::T)(x) = x.\nargs[2]\nA SimpleVector of argument type data. args[2][1] is a SimpleVector of the argument types, and args[2][2] is a SimpleVector of type variables corresponding to the method\'s static parameters.\nargs[3]\nA CodeInfo of the method itself. For \"out of scope\" method definitions (adding a method to a function that also has methods defined in different scopes) this is an expression that evaluates to a :lambda expression.\nargs[4]\ntrue or false, identifying whether the method is staged (@generated function).\nconst\nDeclares a (global) variable as constant.\nnull\nHas no arguments; simply yields the value nothing.\nnew\nAllocates a new struct-like object. First argument is the type. The new pseudo-function is lowered to this, and the type is always inserted by the compiler.  This is very much an internal-only feature, and does no checking. Evaluating arbitrary new expressions can easily segfault.\nreturn\nReturns its argument as the value of the enclosing function.\nthe_exception\nYields the caught exception inside a catch block. This is the value of the run time system variable jl_exception_in_transit.\nenter\nEnters an exception handler (setjmp). args[1] is the label of the catch block to jump to on error.\nleave\nPop exception handlers. args[1] is the number of handlers to pop.\ninbounds\nControls turning bounds checks on or off. A stack is maintained; if the first argument of this expression is true or false (true means bounds checks are disabled), it is pushed onto the stack. If the first argument is :pop, the stack is popped.\nboundscheck\nHas the value false if inlined into a section of code marked with @inbounds, otherwise has the value true.\ncopyast\nPart of the implementation of quasi-quote. The argument is a surface syntax AST that is simply copied recursively and returned at run time.\nmeta\nMetadata. args[1] is typically a symbol specifying the kind of metadata, and the rest of the arguments are free-form. The following kinds of metadata are commonly used:\n:inline and :noinline: Inlining hints."

    "category": "section",
    "text": "It\'s perhaps easiest to conceive of Julia\'s type system in terms of sets. While programs manipulate individual values, a type refers to a set of values. This is not the same thing as a collection; for example a Set of values is itself a single Set value. Rather, a type describes a set of possible values, expressing uncertainty about which value we have.A concrete type T describes the set of values whose direct tag, as returned by the typeof function, is T. An abstract type describes some possibly-larger set of values.Any describes the entire universe of possible values. Integer is a subset of Any that includes Int, Int8, and other concrete types. Internally, Julia also makes heavy use of another type known as Bottom, which can also be written as Union{}. This corresponds to the empty set.Julia\'s types support the standard operations of set theory: you can ask whether T1 is a \"subset\" (subtype) of T2 with T1 <: T2. Likewise, you intersect two types using typeintersect, take their union with Union, and compute a type that contains their union with typejoin:julia> typeintersect(Int, Float64)\nUnion{}\n\njulia> Union{Int, Float64}\nUnion{Float64, Int64}\n\njulia> typejoin(Int, Float64)\nReal\n\njulia> typeintersect(Signed, Union{UInt8, Int8})\nInt8\n\njulia> Union{Signed, Union{UInt8, Int8}}\nUnion{UInt8, Signed}\n\njulia> typejoin(Signed, Union{UInt8, Int8})\nInteger\n\njulia> typeintersect(Tuple{Integer,Float64}, Tuple{Int,Real})\nTuple{Int64,Float64}\n\njulia> Union{Tuple{Integer,Float64}, Tuple{Int,Real}}\nUnion{Tuple{Int64,Real}, Tuple{Integer,Float64}}\n\njulia> typejoin(Tuple{Integer,Float64}, Tuple{Int,Real})\nTuple{Integer,Real}While these operations may seem abstract, they lie at the heart of Julia.  For example, method dispatch is implemented by stepping through the items in a method list until reaching one for which the type of the argument tuple is a subtype of the method signature. For this algorithm to work, it\'s important that methods be sorted by their specificity, and that the search begins with the most specific methods. Consequently, Julia also implements a partial order on types; this is achieved by functionality that is similar to <:, but with differences that will be discussed below."

    "text": "Julia\'s type system can also express an iterated union of types: a union of types over all values of some variable. This is needed to describe parametric types where the values of some parameters are not known.For example, :obj:Array has two parameters as in Array{Int,2}. If we did not know the element type, we could write Array{T,2} where T, which is the union of Array{T,2} for all values of T: Union{Array{Int8,2}, Array{Int16,2}, ...}.Such a type is represented by a UnionAll object, which contains a variable (T in this example, of type TypeVar), and a wrapped type (Array{T,2} in this example).Consider the following methods:f1(A::Array) = 1\nf2(A::Array{Int}) = 2\nf3(A::Array{T}) where {T<:Any} = 3\nf4(A::Array{Any}) = 4The signature of f3 is a UnionAll type wrapping a tuple type. All but f4 can be called with a = [1,2]; all but f2 can be called with b = Any[1,2].Let\'s look at these types a little more closely:julia> dump(Array)\nUnionAll\n  var: TypeVar\n    name: Symbol T\n    lb: Core.TypeofBottom Union{}\n    ub: Any\n  body: UnionAll\n    var: TypeVar\n      name: Symbol N\n      lb: Core.TypeofBottom Union{}\n      ub: Any\n    body: Array{T,N} <: DenseArray{T,N}This indicates that Array actually names a UnionAll type. There is one UnionAll type for each parameter, nested. The syntax Array{Int,2} is equivalent to Array{Int}{2}; internally each UnionAll is instantiated with a particular variable value, one at a time, outermost-first. This gives a natural meaning to the omission of trailing type parameters; Array{Int} gives a type equivalent to Array{Int,N} where N.A TypeVar is not itself a type, but rather should be considered part of the structure of a UnionAll type. Type variables have lower and upper bounds on their values (in the fields lb and ub). The symbol name is purely cosmetic. Internally, TypeVars are compared by address, so they are defined as mutable types to ensure that \"different\" type variables can be distinguished. However, by convention they should not be mutated.One can construct TypeVars manually:julia> TypeVar(:V, Signed, Real)\nSigned<:V<:RealThere are convenience versions that allow you to omit any of these arguments except the name symbol.The syntax Array{T} where T<:Integer is lowered tolet T = TypeVar(:T,Integer)\n    UnionAll(T, Array{T})\nendso it is seldom necessary to construct a TypeVar manually (indeed, this is to be avoided)."

Consider the type Array{Array{T}} where T, which refers to all homogeneous arrays of arrays. The inner type Array{T}, seen by itself, might seem to refer to any kind of array. However, every element of the outer array must have the same array type, so Array{T} cannot refer to just any old array. One could say that Array{T} effectively \"occurs\" multiple times, and T must have the same value each \"time\".For this reason, the function jl_has_free_typevars in the C API is very important.

    "text": "Consider the type Tuple{T,T} where T. A method with this signature would look like:f(x::T, y::T) where {T} = ...According to the usual interpretation of a UnionAll type, this T ranges over all types, including Any, so this type should be equivalent to Tuple{Any,Any}. However, this interpretation causes some practical problems.First, a value of T needs to be available inside the method definition. For a call like f(1, 1.0), it\'s not clear what T should be. It could be Union{Int,Float64}, or perhaps Real. Intuitively, we expect the declaration x::T to mean T === typeof(x). To make sure that invariant holds, we need typeof(x) === typeof(y) === T in this method. That implies the method should only be called for arguments of the exact same type.It turns out that being able to dispatch on whether two values have the same type is very useful (this is used by the promotion system for example), so we have multiple reasons to want a different interpretation of Tuple{T,T} where T. To make this work we add the following rule to subtyping: if a variable occurs more than once in covariant position, it is restricted to ranging over only concrete types. (\"Covariant position\" means that only Tuple and Union types occur between an occurrence of a variable and the UnionAll type that introduces it.) Such variables are called \"diagonal variables\" or \"concrete variables\".So for example, Tuple{T,T} where T can be seen as Union{Tuple{Int8,Int8}, Tuple{Int16,Int16}, ...}, where T ranges over all concrete types. This gives rise to some interesting subtyping results. For example Tuple{Real,Real} is not a subtype of Tuple{T,T} where T, because it includes some types like Tuple{Int8,Int16} where the two elements have different types. Tuple{Real,Real} and Tuple{T,T} where T have the non-trivial intersection Tuple{T,T} where T<:Real. However, Tuple{Real} is a subtype of Tuple{T} where T, because in that case T occurs only once and so is not diagonal.Next consider a signature like the following:f(a::Array{T}, x::T, y::T) where {T} = ...In this case, T occurs in invariant position inside Array{T}. That means whatever type of array is passed unambiguously determines the value of T –- we say T has an equality constraint on it. Therefore in this case the diagonal rule is not really necessary, since the array determines T and we can then allow x and y to be of any subtypes of T. So variables that occur in invariant position are never considered diagonal. This choice of behavior is slightly controversial –- some feel this definition should be written asf(a::Array{T}, x::S, y::S) where {T, S<:T} = ...to clarify whether x and y need to have the same type. In this version of the signature they would, or we could introduce a third variable for the type of y if x and y can have different types.The next complication is the interaction of unions and diagonal variables, e.g.f(x::Union{Nothing,T}, y::T) where {T} = ...Consider what this declaration means. y has type T. x then can have either the same type T, or else be of type Nothing. So all of the following calls should match:f(1, 1)\nf(\"\", \"\")\nf(2.0, 2.0)\nf(nothing, 1)\nf(nothing, \"\")\nf(nothing, 2.0)These examples are telling us something: when x is nothing::Nothing, there are no extra constraints on y. It is as if the method signature had y::Any. This means that whether a variable is diagonal is not a static property based on where it appears in a type. Rather, it depends on where a variable appears when the subtyping algorithm uses it. When x has type Nothing, we don\'t need to use the T in Union{Nothing,T}, so T does not \"occur\". Indeed, we have the following type equivalence:(Tuple{Union{Nothing,T},T} where T) == Union{Tuple{Nothing,Any}, Tuple{T,T} where T}"

    "category": "section",
    "text": "The subtyping algorithm for diagonal variables has two components: (1) identifying variable occurrences, and (2) ensuring that diagonal variables range over concrete types only.The first task is accomplished by keeping counters occurs_inv and occurs_cov (in src/subtype.c) for each variable in the environment, tracking the number of invariant and covariant occurrences, respectively. A variable is diagonal when occurs_inv == 0 && occurs_cov > 1.The second task is accomplished by imposing a condition on a variable\'s lower bound. As the subtyping algorithm runs, it narrows the bounds of each variable (raising lower bounds and lowering upper bounds) to keep track of the range of variable values for which the subtype relation would hold. When we are done evaluating the body of a UnionAll type whose variable is diagonal, we look at the final values of the bounds. Since the variable must be concrete, a contradiction occurs if its lower bound could not be a subtype of a concrete type. For example, an abstract type like AbstractArray cannot be a subtype of a concrete type, but a concrete type like Int can be, and the empty type Bottom can be as well. If a lower bound fails this test the algorithm stops with the answer false.For example, in the problem Tuple{Int,String} <: Tuple{T,T} where T, we derive that this would be true if T were a supertype of Union{Int,String}. However, Union{Int,String} is an abstract type, so the relation does not hold.This concreteness test is done by the function is_leaf_bound. Note that this test is slightly different from jl_is_leaf_type, since it also returns true for Bottom. Currently this function is heuristic, and does not catch all possible concrete types. The difficulty is that whether a lower bound is concrete might depend on the values of other type variable bounds. For example, Vector{T} is equivalent to the concrete type Vector{Int} only if both the upper and lower bounds of T equal Int. We have not yet worked out a complete algorithm for this."

The \"egal\" test (corresponding to the === function in Julia), should instead be used to compare two unknown objects for equivalence:int jl_egal(jl_value_t *a, jl_value_t *b);This optimization should be relatively transparent to the API, since the object will be \"boxed\" on-demand, whenever a jl_value_t pointer is needed.Note that modification of a jl_value_t pointer in memory is permitted only if the object is mutable. Otherwise, modification of the value may corrupt the program and the result will be undefined.

Otherwise, it will start an interactive REPL.\nSkipping the details about how the REPL interacts with the user, let\'s just say the program ends up with a block of code that it wants to run.\nIf the block of code to run is in a file, jl_load(char *filename) gets invoked to load the file and parse it.

If so, it passes off the code to the toplevel interpreter.\njl_toplevel_eval_flex() then expands the code to eliminate any macros and to \"lower\" the AST to make it simpler to execute.\njl_toplevel_eval_flex() then uses some simple heuristics to decide whether to JIT compiler the  AST or to interpret it directly.\nThe bulk of the work to interpret code is handled by eval in interpreter.c.\nIf instead, the code is compiled, the bulk of the work is handled by codegen.cpp. Whenever a  Julia function is called for the first time with a given set of argument types, type inference  will be run on that function. This information is used by the codegen step to generate  faster code.\nEventually, the user quits the REPL, or the end of the program is reached, and the _start()  method returns.\nJust before exiting, main() calls jl_atexit_hook(exit_code).

This is because the type might have parameters, and so needs to take part in dispatch.

In the first kind of API, the \"arguments\" part does not contain information about the function, since that is passed separately. In the second kind of API, the function is the first element of the argument structure.For example, the following function for performing a call accepts just an args pointer, so the first element of the args array will be the function to call:jl_value_t *jl_apply(jl_value_t **args, uint32_t nargs)This entry point for the same functionality accepts the function separately, so the args array does not contain the function:jl_value_t *jl_call(jl_function_t *f, jl_value_t **args, int32_t nargs);"

The first is a function that accepts all arguments (including keyword arguments) as positional arguments, and includes the code for the method body. It has an auto-generated name:function #circle#1(color, fill::Bool, options, circle, center, radius)\n    # draw\nendThe second method is an ordinary definition for the original circle function, which handles the case where no keyword arguments are passed:function circle(center, radius)\n    #circle#1(black, true, pairs(NamedTuple()), circle, center, radius)\nendThis simply dispatches to the first method, passing along default values. pairs is applied to the named tuple of rest arguments to provide key-value pair iteration. Note that if the method doesn\'t accept rest keyword arguments then this argument is absent.Finally there is the kwsorter definition:function (::Core.kwftype(typeof(circle)))(kws, circle, center, radius)\n    if haskey(kws, :color)\n        color = kws.color\n    else\n        color = black\n    end\n    # etc.\n\n    # put remaining kwargs in `options`\n    options = structdiff(kws, NamedTuple{(:color, :fill)})\n\n    # if the method doesn\'t accept rest keywords, throw an error\n    # unless `options` is empty\n\n    #circle#1(color, fill, pairs(options), circle, center, radius)\nendThe function Core.kwftype(t) creates the field t.name.mt.kwsorter (if it hasn\'t been created yet), and returns the type of that function.This design has the feature that call sites that don\'t use keyword arguments require no special handling; everything works as if they were not part of the language at all. Call sites that do use keyword arguments are dispatched directly to the called function\'s kwsorter. For example the call:circle((0,0), 1.0, color = red; other...)is lowered to:kwfunc(circle)(merge((color = red,), other), circle, (0,0), 1.0)kwfunc (also inCore) fetches the kwsorter for the called function. The keyword splatting operation (written as other...) calls the named tuple merge function. This function further unpacks each element of other, expecting each one to contain two values (a symbol and a value). Naturally, a more efficient implementation is available if all splatted arguments are named tuples. Notice that the original circle function is passed through, to handle closures."

    "text": "Generating a new type for every function has potentially serious consequences for compiler resource use when combined with Julia\'s \"specialize on all arguments by default\" design. Indeed, the initial implementation of this design suffered from much longer build and test times, higher memory use, and a system image nearly 2x larger than the baseline. In a naive implementation, the problem is bad enough to make the system nearly unusable. Several significant optimizations were needed to make the design practical.The first issue is excessive specialization of functions for different values of function-valued arguments. Many functions simply \"pass through\" an argument to somewhere else, e.g. to another function or to a storage location. Such functions do not need to be specialized for every closure that might be passed in. Fortunately this case is easy to distinguish by simply considering whether a function calls one of its arguments (i.e. the argument appears in \"head position\" somewhere). Performance-critical higher-order functions like map certainly call their argument function and so will still be specialized as expected. This optimization is implemented by recording which arguments are called during the analyze-variables pass in the front end. When cache_method sees an argument in the Function type hierarchy passed to a slot declared as Any or Function, it behaves as if the @nospecialize annotation were applied. This heuristic seems to be extremely effective in practice.The next issue concerns the structure of method cache hash tables. Empirical studies show that the vast majority of dynamically-dispatched calls involve one or two arguments. In turn, many of these cases can be resolved by considering only the first argument. (Aside: proponents of single dispatch would not be surprised by this at all. However, this argument means \"multiple dispatch is easy to optimize in practice\", and that we should therefore use it, not \"we should use single dispatch\"!) So the method cache uses the type of the first argument as its primary key. Note, however, that this corresponds to the second element of the tuple type for a function call (the first element being the type of the function itself). Typically, type variation in head position is extremely low – indeed, the majority of functions belong to singleton types with no parameters. However, this is not the case for constructors, where a single method table holds constructors for every type. Therefore the Type method table is special-cased to use the first tuple type element instead of the second.The front end generates type declarations for all closures. Initially, this was implemented by generating normal type declarations. However, this produced an extremely large number of constructors, all of which were trivial (simply passing all arguments through to new). Since methods are partially ordered, inserting all of these methods is O(n^2), plus there are just too many of them to keep around. This was optimized by generating struct_type expressions directly (bypassing default constructor generation), and using new directly to create closure instances. Not the prettiest thing ever, but you do what you gotta do.The next problem was the @test macro, which generated a 0-argument closure for each test case. This is not really necessary, since each test case is simply run once in place. Therefore, @test was modified to expand to a try-catch block that records the test result (true, false, or exception raised) and calls the test suite handler on it."

    "text": "Broadly speaking, there are two main ways to access data in an array. The first, often called cartesian indexing, uses N indices for an N -dimensional AbstractArray.  For example, a matrix A (2-dimensional) can be indexed in cartesian style as A[i,j].  The second indexing method, referred to as linear indexing, uses a single index even for higher-dimensional objects.  For example, if A = reshape(1:12, 3, 4), then the expression A[5] returns the value 5.  Julia allows you to combine these styles of indexing: for example, a 3d array A3 can be indexed as A3[i,j], in which case i is interpreted as a cartesian index for the first dimension, and j is a linear index over dimensions 2 and 3.For Arrays, linear indexing appeals to the underlying storage format: an array is laid out as a contiguous block of memory, and hence the linear index is just the offset (+1) of the corresponding entry relative to the beginning of the array.  However, this is not true for many other AbstractArray types: examples include SparseMatrixCSC from the SparseArrays standard library module, arrays that require some kind of computation (such as interpolation), and the type under discussion here, SubArray. For these types, the underlying information is more naturally described in terms of cartesian indices.The getindex and setindex! functions for AbstractArray types may include automatic conversion between indexing types. For explicit conversion, CartesianIndices can be used.While converting from a cartesian index to a linear index is fast (it\'s just multiplication and addition), converting from a linear index to a cartesian index is very slow: it relies on the div operation, which is one of the slowest low-level operations you can perform with a CPU.  For this reason, any code that deals with AbstractArray types is best designed in terms of cartesian, rather than linear, indexing."

While not strictly necessary, it means that we can define dispatch directly on SubArray{T,N,A,I,true} without any intermediaries.Since this computation doesn\'t depend on runtime values, it can miss some cases in which the stride happens to be uniform:julia> A = reshape(1:4*2, 4, 2)\n4×2 reshape(::UnitRange{Int64}, 4, 2) with eltype Int64:\n 1  5\n 2  6\n 3  7\n 4  8\n\njulia> diff(A[2:2:4,:][:])\n3-element Array{Int64,1}:\n 2\n 2\n 2A view constructed as view(A, 2:2:4, :) happens to have uniform stride, and therefore linear indexing indeed could be performed efficiently.  However, success in this case depends on the size of the array: if the first dimension instead were odd,julia> A = reshape(1:5*2, 5, 2)\n5×2 reshape(::UnitRange{Int64}, 5, 2) with eltype Int64:\n 1   6\n 2   7\n 3   8\n 4   9\n 5  10\n\njulia> diff(A[2:2:4,:][:])\n3-element Array{Int64,1}:\n 2\n 3\n 2then A[2:2:4,:] does not have uniform stride, so we cannot guarantee efficient linear indexing.  Since we have to base this decision based purely on types encoded in the parameters of the SubArray, S = view(A, 2:2:4, :) cannot implement efficient linear indexing."

    "text": "Note that the Base.reindex function is agnostic to the types of the input indices; it simply determines how and where the stored indices should be reindexed. It not only supports integer indices, but it supports non-scalar indexing, too. This means that views of views don\'t need two levels of indirection; they can simply re-compute the indices into the original parent array!\nHopefully by now it\'s fairly clear that supporting slices means that the dimensionality, given by the parameter N, is not necessarily equal to the dimensionality of the parent array or the length of the indices tuple.  Neither do user-supplied indices necessarily line up with entries in the indices tuple (e.g., the second user-supplied index might correspond to the third dimension of the parent array, and the third element in the indices tuple).\nWhat might be less obvious is that the dimensionality of the stored parent array must be equal to the number of effective indices in the indices tuple. Some examples:\nA = reshape(1:35, 5, 7) # A 2d parent Array\nS = view(A, 2:7)         # A 1d view created by linear indexing\nS = view(A, :, :, 1:1)   # Appending extra indices is supported\nNaively, you\'d think you could just set S.parent = A and S.indices = (:,:,1:1), but supporting this dramatically complicates the reindexing process, especially for views of views. Not only do you need to dispatch on the types of the stored indices, but you need to examine whether a given index is the final one and \"merge\" any remaining stored indices together. This is not an easy task, and even worse: it\'s slow since it implicitly depends upon linear indexing.\nFortunately, this is precisely the computation that ReshapedArray performs, and it does so linearly if possible. Consequently, view ensures that the parent array is the appropriate dimensionality for the given indices by reshaping it if needed. The inner SubArray constructor ensures that this invariant is satisfied.\nCartesianIndex and arrays thereof throw a nasty wrench into the reindex scheme. Recall that reindex simply dispatches on the type of the stored indices in order to determine how many passed indices should be used and where they should go. But with CartesianIndex, there\'s no longer a one-to-one correspondence between the number of passed arguments and the number of dimensions that they index into. If we return to the above example of Base.reindex(S1, S1.indices, (i, j)), you can see that the expansion is incorrect for i, j = CartesianIndex(), CartesianIndex(2,1). It should skip the CartesianIndex() entirely and return:\n(CartesianIndex(2,1)[1], S1.indices[2], S1.indices[3][CartesianIndex(2,1)[2]])\nInstead, though, we get:\n(CartesianIndex(), S1.indices[2], S1.indices[3][CartesianIndex(2,1)])\nDoing this correctly would require combined dispatch on both the stored and passed indices across all combinations of dimensionalities in an intractable manner. As such, reindex must never be called with CartesianIndex indices. Fortunately, the scalar case is easily handled by first flattening the CartesianIndex arguments to plain integers. Arrays of CartesianIndex, however, cannot be split apart into orthogonal pieces so easily. Before attempting to use reindex, view must ensure that there are no arrays of CartesianIndex in the argument list. If there are, it can simply \"punt\" by avoiding the reindex calculation entirely, constructing a nested SubArray with two levels of indirection instead."

The distinction is whether the value itself is stored inline (in the direct allocated memory of the array), or if the memory of the array is simply a collection of pointers to objects allocated elsewhere. In terms of performance, accessing values inline is clearly an advantage over having to follow a pointer to the actual value. The definition of \"isbits\" generally means any Julia type with a fixed, determinate size, meaning no \"pointer\" fields, see ?isbitstype.Julia also supports Union types, quite literally the union of a set of types. Custom Union type definitions can be extremely handy for applications wishing to \"cut across\" the nominal type system (i.e. explicit subtype relationships) and define methods or functionality on these, otherwise unrelated, set of types. A compiler challenge, however, is in determining how to treat these Union types. The naive approach (and indeed, what Julia itself did pre-0.7), is to simply make a \"box\" and then a pointer in the box to the actual value, similar to the previously mentioned \"boxed\" values. This is unfortunate, however, because of the number of small, primitive \"bits\" types (think UInt8, Int32, Float64, etc.) that would easily fit themselves inline in this \"box\" without needing any indirection for value access. There are two main ways Julia can take advantage of this optimization as of 0.7: isbits Union fields in types, and isbits Union Arrays."

This is accomplished by determining the \"inline size\" of the Union type (e.g. Union{UInt8, Int16} will have a size of 16 bytes, which represents the size needed of the largest Union type Int16), and in addition, allocating an extra \"type tag byte\" (UInt8), whose value signals the type of the actual value stored inline of the \"Union bytes\". The type tag byte value is the index of the actual value\'s type in the Union type\'s order of types. For example, a type tag value of 0x02 for a field with type Union{Nothing, UInt8, Int16} would indicate that an Int16 value is stored in the 16 bytes of the field in the structure\'s memory; a 0x01 value would indicate that a UInt8 value was stored in the first 8 bytes of the 16 bytes of the field\'s memory. Lastly, a value of 0x00 signals that the nothing value will be returned for this field, even though, as a singleton type with a single type instance, it technically has a size of 0. The type tag byte for a type\'s Union field is stored directly after the field\'s computed Union memory."

The optimization is accomplished by storing an extra \"type tag array\" of bytes, one byte per array element, alongside the bytes of the actual array data. This type tag array serves the same function as the type field case: it\'s value signals the type of the actual stored Union value in the array. In terms of layout, a Julia Array can include extra \"buffer\" space before and after it\'s actual data values, which are tracked in the a->offset and a->maxsize fields of the jl_array_t* type. The \"type tag array\" is treated exactly as another jl_array_t*, but which shares the same a->offset, a->maxsize, and a->len fields. So the formula to access an isbits Union Array\'s type tag bytes is a->data + (a->maxsize - a->offset) * a->elsize + a->offset; i.e. the Array\'s a->data pointer is already shifted by a->offset, so correcting for that, we follow the data all the way to the max of what it can hold a->maxsize, then adjust by a->ofset more bytes to account for any present \"front buffering\" the array might be doing. This layout in particular allows for very efficient resizing operations as the type tag data only ever has to move when the actual array\'s data has to move."

Now, we could perform a straightforward lowering and emit an alloca for the argument array. However, this would betray the SSA nature of the uses at the call site, making optimizations (including GC root placement), significantly harder. Instead, we emit it as follows:%bitcast = bitcast @any_unoptimized_call to %jl_value_t *(*)(%jl_value_t *, %jl_value_t *)\ncall cc 37 %jl_value_t *%bitcast(%jl_value_t *%arg1, %jl_value_t *%arg2)The special cc 37 annotation marks the fact that this call site is really using the jlcall calling convention.

As an example, consider an error pathif some_condition()\n    #= Use some variables maybe =#\n    error(\"An error occurred\")\nendDuring constant folding, LLVM may discover that the condition is always false, and can remove the basic block. However, if GC root lowering is done early, the GC root slots used in the deleted block, as well as any values kept alive in those slots only because they were used in the error path, would be kept alive by LLVM. By doing GC root lowering late, we give LLVM the license to do any of its usual optimizations (constant folding, dead code elimination, etc.), without having to worry (too much) about which values may or may not be GC tracked.However, in order to be able to do late GC root placement, we need to be able to identify a) which pointers are GC tracked and b) all uses of such pointers. The goal of the GC placement pass is thus simple:Minimize the number of needed GC roots/stores to them subject to the constraint that at every safepoint, any live GC-tracked pointer (i.e. for which there is a path after this point that contains a use of this pointer) is in some GC slot."

The compiler may not insert casts between address spaces that did not exist in the original program and it must never change the address space of a pointer on a load/store/etc operation. This allows us to annotate which pointers are GC-tracked in an optimizer-resistant way. Note that metadata would not be able to achieve the same purpose. Metadata is supposed to always be discardable without altering the semantics of the program. However, failing to identify a GC-tracked pointer alters the resulting program behavior dramatically - it\'ll probably crash or return wrong results. We currently use three different address spaces (their numbers are defined in src/codegen_shared.cpp):GC Tracked Pointers (currently 10): These are pointers to boxed values that may be put into a GC frame. It is loosely equivalent to a jl_value_t* pointer on the C side. N.B. It is illegal to ever have a pointer in this address space that may not be stored to a GC slot.\nDerived Pointers (currently 11): These are pointers that are derived from some GC tracked pointer. Uses of these pointers generate uses of the original pointer. However, they need not themselves be known to the GC. The GC root placement pass MUST always find the GC tracked pointer from which this pointer is derived and use that as the pointer to root.\nCallee Rooted Pointers (currently 12): This is a utility address space to express the notion of a callee rooted value. All values of this address space MUST be storable to a GC root (though it is possible to relax this condition in the future), but unlike the other pointers need not be rooted if passed to a call (they do still need to be rooted if they are live across another safepoint between the definition and the call).\nPointers loaded from tracked object (currently 13): This is used by arrays, which themselves contain a pointer to the managed data.

It is never safe to have a value in address space 0 in any part of the program if it is (or is derived from) a value that requires a GC root.\nTracked->Derived: This is the standard decay route for interior values. The placement pass will look for these to identify the base pointer for any use.\nTracked->CalleeRooted: Addrspace CalleeRooted serves merely as a hint that a GC root is not required. However, do note that the Derived->CalleeRooted decay is prohibited, since pointers should generally be storable to a GC slot, even in this address space.Now let us consider what constitutes a use:Loads whose loaded values is in one of the address spaces\nStores of a value in one of the address spaces to a location\nStores to a pointer in one of the address spaces\nCalls for which a value in one of the address spaces is an operand\nCalls in jlcall ABI, for which the argument array contains a value\nReturn instructions.We explicitly allow load/stores and simple calls in address spaces Tracked/Derived. Elements of jlcall argument arrays must always be in address space Tracked (it is required by the ABI that they are valid jl_value_t* pointers). The same is true for return instructions (though note that struct return arguments are allowed to have any of the address spaces). The only allowable use of an address space CalleeRooted pointer is to pass it to a call (which must have an appropriately typed operand).Further, we disallow getelementptr in addrspace Tracked. This is because unless the operation is a noop, the resulting pointer will not be validly storable to a GC slot and may thus not be in this address space. If such a pointer is required, it should be decayed to addrspace Derived first.Lastly, we disallow inttoptr/ptrtoint instructions in these address spaces. Having these instructions would mean that some i64 values are really GC tracked. This is problematic, because it breaks that stated requirement that we\'re able to identify GC-relevant pointers. This invariant is accomplished using the LLVM \"non-integral pointers\" feature, which is new in LLVM 5.0. It prohibits the optimizer from making optimizations that would introduce these operations. Note we can still insert static constants at JIT time by using inttoptr in address space 0 and then decaying to the appropriate address space afterwards."

As an example consider:A = randn(1024)\nccall(:foo, Cvoid, (Ptr{Float64},), A)In lowering, the compiler will insert a conversion from the array to the pointer which drops the reference to the array value. However, we of course need to make sure that the array does stay alive while we\'re doing the ccall. To understand how this is done, first recall the lowering of the above code:return $(Expr(:foreigncall, :(:foo), Cvoid, svec(Ptr{Float64}), :(:ccall), 1, :($(Expr(:foreigncall, :(:jl_array_ptr), Ptr{Float64}, svec(Any), :(:ccall), 1, :(A)))), :(A)))The last :(A), is an extra argument list inserted during lowering that informs the code generator which Julia level values need to be kept alive for the duration of this ccall. We then take this information and represent it in an \"operand bundle\" at the IR level. An operand bundle is essentially a fake use that is attached to the call site. At the IR level, this looks like so:call void inttoptr (i64 ... to void (double*)*)(double* %5) [ \"jl_roots\"(%jl_value_t addrspace(10)* %A) ]The GC root placement pass will treat the jl_roots operand bundle as if it were a regular operand. However, as a final step, after the GC roots are inserted, it will drop the operand bundle to avoid confusing instruction selection."

Indices are specified as tuples, and are usually compared in a 1-1 fashion with individual dimensions handled by calling another important function, checkindex: typically,checkbounds_indices(Bool, (IA1, IA...), (I1, I...)) = checkindex(Bool, IA1, I1) &\n                                                      checkbounds_indices(Bool, IA, I)so checkindex checks a single dimension.

However, in most cases you should be able to rely on checkbounds_indices as long as you supply useful axes for your array type.If you have novel index types, first consider specializing checkindex, which handles a single index for a particular dimension of an array.  If you have a custom multidimensional index type (similar to CartesianIndex), then you may have to consider specializing checkbounds_indices.Note this hierarchy has been designed to reduce the likelihood of method ambiguities.

This will return axes(A, 1) if A is an AbstractVector, and the equivalent of 1:length(A) otherwise.By this definition, 1-dimensional arrays always use Cartesian indexing with the array\'s native indices.

    "text": "If you\'re writing a non-1 indexed array type, you will want to specialize axes so it returns a UnitRange, or (perhaps better) a custom AbstractUnitRange.  The advantage of a custom type is that it \"signals\" the allocation type for functions like similar. If we\'re writing an array type for which indexing will start at 0, we likely want to begin by creating a new AbstractUnitRange, ZeroRange, where ZeroRange(n) is equivalent to 0:n-1.In general, you should probably not export ZeroRange from your package: there may be other packages that implement their own ZeroRange, and having multiple distinct ZeroRange types is (perhaps counterintuitively) an advantage: ModuleA.ZeroRange indicates that similar should create a ModuleA.ZeroArray, whereas ModuleB.ZeroRange indicates a ModuleB.ZeroArray type.  This design allows peaceful coexistence among many different custom array types.Note that the Julia package CustomUnitRanges.jl can sometimes be used to avoid the need to write your own ZeroRange type."

Likewise, in Base there is a dedicated function indices1 which is equivalent to axes(A, 1) but which avoids checking (at runtime) whether ndims(A) > 0. (This is purely a performance optimization.)  It is defined as:indices1(A::AbstractArray{T,0}) where {T} = OneTo(1)\nindices1(A::AbstractArray) = axes(A)[1]If the first of these (the zero-dimensional case) is problematic for your custom array type, be sure to specialize it appropriately."

    "category": "section",
    "text": "Much of the hardest work for inlining runs in inlining_pass. However, if your question is \"why didn\'t my function inline?\" then you will most likely be interested in isinlineable and its primary callee, inline_worthy. isinlineable handles a number of special cases (e.g., critical functions like next and done, incorporating a bonus for functions that return tuples, etc.). The main decision-making happens in inline_worthy, which returns true if the function should be inlined.inline_worthy implements a cost-model, where \"cheap\" functions get inlined; more specifically, we inline functions if their anticipated run-time is not large compared to the time it would take to issue a call to them if they were not inlined. The cost-model is extremely simple and ignores many important details: for example, all for loops are analyzed as if they will be executed once, and the cost of an if...else...end includes the summed cost of all branches. It\'s also worth acknowledging that we currently lack a suite of functions suitable for testing how well the cost model predicts the actual run-time cost, although BaseBenchmarks provides a great deal of indirect information about the successes and failures of any modification to the inlining algorithm.The foundation of the cost-model is a lookup table, implemented in add_tfunc and its callers, that assigns an estimated cost (measured in CPU cycles) to each of Julia\'s intrinsic functions. These costs are based on standard ranges for common architectures (see Agner Fog\'s analysis for more detail).We supplement this low-level lookup table with a number of special cases. For example, an :invoke expression (a call for which all input and output types were inferred in advance) is assigned a fixed cost (currently 20 cycles). In contrast, a :call expression, for functions other than intrinsics/builtins, indicates that the call will require dynamic dispatch, in which case we assign a cost set by Params.inline_nonleaf_penalty (currently set at 1000). Note that this is not a \"first-principles\" estimate of the raw cost of dynamic dispatch, but a mere heuristic indicating that dynamic dispatch is extremely expensive.Each statement gets analyzed for its total cost in a function called statement_cost. You can run this yourself by following this example:params = Core.Compiler.Params(typemax(UInt))\n# Get the CodeInfo object\nci = (@code_typed fill(3, (5, 5)))[1]  # we\'ll try this on the code for `fill(3, (5, 5))`\n# Calculate cost of each statement\ncost(stmt) = Core.Compiler.statement_cost(stmt, ci, Base, params)\ncst = map(cost, ci.code)The output is a Vector{Int} holding the estimated cost of each statement in ci.code.  Note that ci includes the consequences of inlining callees, and consequently the costs do too."

(some operating systems may require alternative approaches, such as following each fork from the parent process)"

    "text": "By default, Valgrind assumes that there is no self modifying code in the programs it runs.  This assumption works fine in most instances but fails miserably for a just-in-time compiler like julia.  For this reason it is crucial to pass --smc-check=all-non-file to valgrind, else code may crash or behave unexpectedly (often in subtle ways).In some cases, to better detect memory errors using Valgrind it can help to compile julia with memory pools disabled.  The compile-time flag MEMDEBUG disables memory pools in Julia, and MEMDEBUG2 disables memory pools in FemtoLisp.  To build julia with both flags, add the following line to Make.user:CFLAGS = -DMEMDEBUG -DMEMDEBUG2Another thing to note: if your program uses multiple workers processes, it is likely that you want all such worker processes to run under Valgrind, not just the parent process.  To do this, pass --trace-children=yes to valgrind."

Note that some versions of Valgrind are shipped with insufficient default suppressions, so that may be one thing to consider before submitting any bugs."

This will enable the minimal Valgrind machinery but will also run much faster than when the full memory checker is enabled."

This implies that the LLVM version of your host compiler matches that of the LLVM library used within Julia.An easy solution is to have an dedicated build folder for providing a matching toolchain, by building with BUILD_LLVM_CLANG=1. You can then refer to this toolchain from another build folder by specifying USECLANG=1 while overriding the CC and CXX variables."

    "text": "For detecting or debugging memory bugs, you can use Clang\'s address sanitizer (ASAN). By compiling with SANITIZE=1 you enable ASAN for the Julia compiler and its generated code. In addition, you can specify LLVM_SANITIZE=1 to sanitize the LLVM library as well. Note that these options incur a high performance and memory cost. For example, using ASAN for Julia and LLVM makes testall1 takes 8-10 times as long while using 20 times as much memory (this can be reduced to respectively a factor of 3 and 4 by using the options described below).By default, Julia sets the allow_user_segv_handler=1 ASAN flag, which is required for signal delivery to work properly. You can define other options using the ASAN_OPTIONS environment flag, in which case you\'ll need to repeat the default option mentioned before. For example, memory usage can be reduced by specifying fast_unwind_on_malloc=0 and malloc_context_size=2, at the cost of backtrace accuracy. For now, Julia also sets detect_leaks=0, but this should be removed in the future."
