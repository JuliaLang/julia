# This test has not been added to CI as there can be unexpected delays
# which cause timing-dependent actions to fail.

#=
Test to ensure that the interactive threadpool works as designed.

Task A is a standard task that does a lot of work (~2 seconds) without
yielding. This would prevent ordinarily prevent other tasks from running.

Task B is an interactive task that does a little work (~0.02 seconds) and
yields.

With an interactive threadpool, multiple task Bs should not see notable
delays in execution even when multiple task As are occupying Julia's
default threads.

This test should fail in the absence of an interactive thread.
