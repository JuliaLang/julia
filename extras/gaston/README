Gaston

A gnuplot interface for the julia language.

1. Setup

Put the files gaston.jl, gastonini.jl, gastonaux.jl and gastondemo.jl
somewhere convinient. Then, you may cd to that directory and start julia there,
or do

push(LOAD_PATH, "/path/to/gaston/jl")

Then, load the program with

	load("gaston.jl")

2. Tests/Demo

To run a demo (which also tests all of Gaston's capabilites), do

	load("gastondemo.jl")
	demo()

This will create a series of figures that illustrate the current capabilites
of the program. The same file may also show how to create different types
of plots.

3. Documentation

For a more detailed description of the program, see doc/gastondoc.pdf
