To do file for Gaston

v 0.5:

* keep improving error checking
* keep improving documentation
* remove the restriction to have only one image per figure
* add high-level plotting functions for 3-d and images
* add unit tests that try to break the program
* add demo for high-level functions
* add support for pdfcairo (or pngcairo?) for basic print-to-file support

v 0.6 and later:

* keep improving error checking
* keep improving documentation
* improve high-level, 'quick plot' functions, similar to Octave's
* improve demo() and unit tests as needed
* review type annotations to see if they can be improved
* review which other plot styles may be supported (filledcurves, map, dot)
* add suport for setting the colormap
* add debug options: print gnuplot command line, etc
* let image types specify x,y coordinates (will allow spectrograms)
* review the new 'optional arguments' framework and see if we can use it
* allow user setting gnuplot command
* add support for curve smoothing
* look into the mmap interface to avoid creating files
