# Syntax Trees

This section describes the syntax trees produced by JuliaSyntax, mainly in
terms of their similarities and differences with the `Expr` tree data
structures used since Julia 0.1.

## JuliaSyntax trees vs `Expr`

The tree structure of `GreenNode`/`SyntaxNode` is similar to Julia's `Expr`
data structure but there are various differences:

### Source ordered children

The children of our trees are strictly in source order. This has many
consequences in places where `Expr` reorders child expressions.

* Infix and postfix operator calls have the operator name in the *second* child position. `a + b` is parsed as `(call-i a + b)` - where the infix `-i` flag indicates infix child position - rather than `Expr(:call, :+, :a, :b)`.
* Generators are represented in source order as a single node rather than multiple nested flatten and generator expressions.

### No `LineNumberNode`s

Our syntax nodes inherently stores source position, so there's no need for the
`LineNumberNode`s used by `Expr`.

### More consistent / less redundant `block`s

Sometimes `Expr` needs redundant block constructs to store `LineNumberNode`s,
but we don't need these. Also in cases which do use blocks we try to use them
consistently.

* No block is used on the right hand side of short form function syntax
* No block is used for the conditional in `elseif`
* No block is used for the body of anonymous functions after the `->`
* `let` argument lists always use a block regardless of number or form of bindings

### Faithful representation of the source text / avoid premature lowering

Some cases of "premature lowering" have been removed, preferring to represent
the source text more closely.

* `K"macrocall"` - allow users to easily distinguish macrocalls with parentheses from those without them (#218)
* Grouping parentheses are represented with a node of kind `K"parens"` (#222)
* The right hand side of `x where {T}` retains the `K"braces"` node around the `T` to distinguish it from `x where T`.
* Ternary syntax is not immediately lowered to an `if` node: `a ? b : c` parses as `(? a b c)` rather than `Expr(:if, :a, :b, :c)` (#85)
* `global const` and `const global` are not normalized by the parser. This is done in `Expr` conversion (#130)
* [`do` syntax](#Do-blocks) is nested as the last child of the call which the `do` lambda will be passed to (#98, #322)
* `@.` is not lowered to `@__dot__` inside the parser (#146)
* Docstrings use the `K"doc"` kind, and are not lowered to `Core.@doc` until later (#217)
* Juxtaposition uses the `K"juxtapose"` kind rather than lowering immediately to `*` (#220)
* `return` without a value has zero children, rather than lowering to `return nothing` (#220)
* Command syntax `` `foo` `` parses into a `cmdstring` tree node wrapping the string, as `(cmdstring "foo")` (#438). These are lowered to a macro call later rather than by the parser.

### Containers for string-like constructs

String-like constructs always come within a container node, not as a single
token. These are useful for tooling which works with the tokens of the source
text. Also separating the delimiters from the text they delimit removes a whole
class of tokenization errors and lets the parser deal with them.

* string always use `K"string"` to wrap strings, even when they only contain a single string chunk (#94)
* char literals are wrapped in the `K"char"` kind, containing the character literal string along with their delimiters (#121)
* backticks use the `K"cmdstring"` kind
* `var""` syntax uses `K"var"` as the head (#127)
* The parser splits triple quoted strings into string chunks interspersed with whitespace trivia

### Improvements for AST inconsistencies

* Field access syntax like `a.b` is parsed as `(. a b)` rather than `(. a (quote b))` to avoid the inconsistency between this and actual quoted syntax literals like `:(b)` and `quote b end` ([#342](https://github.com/JuliaLang/JuliaSyntax.jl/issues/324))
* Dotted call syntax like `f.(a,b)` and `a .+ b` has been made consistent with the `K"dotcall"` head (#90)
* Standalone dotted operators are always parsed as `(. op)`. For example `.*(x,y)` is parsed as `(call (. *) x y)` (#240)
* The `K"="` kind is used for keyword syntax rather than `kw`, to avoid various inconsistencies and ambiguities (#103)
* Unadorned postfix adjoint is parsed as `call` rather than as a syntactic operator for consistency with suffixed versions like `x'ᵀ` (#124)
* The argument list in the left hand side of `->` is always a tuple. For example, `x->y` parses as `(-> (tuple x) y)` rather than `(-> x y)` (#522)

### Improvements to awkward AST forms

* `FrankenTuple`s with multiple parameter blocks like `(a=1, b=2; c=3; d=4)` are flattened into the parent tuple instead of using nested `K"parameters"` nodes (#133)
* Using `try catch else finally end` is parsed with `K"catch"` `K"else"` and `K"finally"` children to avoid the awkwardness of the optional child nodes in the `Expr` representation (#234)
* The dotted import path syntax as in `import A.b.c` is parsed with a `K"importpath"` kind rather than `K"."`, because a bare `A.b.c` has a very different nested/quoted expression representation (#244)
* We use flags rather than child nodes to represent the difference between `struct` and `mutable struct`, `module` and `baremodule` (#220)
* Iterations are represented with the `iteration` and `in` heads rather than `=` within the header of a `for`. Thus `for i=is ; body end` parses to `(for (iteration (in i is)) (block body))`. Cartesian iteration as in `for a=as, b=bs body end` are represented with a nested `(iteration (in a as) (in b bs))` rather than a `block` containing `=` because these lists of iterators are neither semantically nor syntactically a sequence of statements, unlike other uses of `block`. Generators also use the `iteration` head - see information on that below.
* Short form functions like `f(x) = x + 1` are represented with the `function` head rather than the `=` head. In this case the `SHORT_FORM_FUNCTION_FLAG` flag is set to allow the surface syntactic form to be easily distinguished from long form functions.
* All kinds of updating assignment operators like `+=` are represented with a single `K"op="` head, with the operator itself in infix position. For example, `x += 1` is `(op= x + 1)`, where the plus token is of kind `K"Identifier"`. This greatly reduces the number of distinct forms here from a rather big list (`$=` `%=` `&=` `*=` `+=` `-=` `//=` `/=` `<<=` `>>=` `>>>=` `\=` `^=` `|=` `÷=` `⊻=`) and makes the operator itself appear in the AST as kind `K"Identifier"`, as it should. It also makes it possible to add further unicode updating operators while keeping the AST stable.

## More detail on tree differences

### Generators

Flattened generators are uniquely problematic because the Julia AST doesn't
respect a key rule we normally expect: that the children of an AST node are a
*contiguous* range in the source text. For example, the `for`s in
`[xy for x in xs for y in ys]` are parsed in the normal order of a for loop to
mean

```
for x in xs
    for y in ys
        push!(xy, collection)
    end
end
```

so the `xy` prefix is in the *body* of the innermost for loop. Following this,
the standard Julia AST is like so:

```
(flatten
  (generator
    (generator
      xy
      (= y ys))
    (= x xs)))
```

however, note that if this tree were flattened, the order would be
`(xy) (y in ys) (x in xs)` and the `x` and `y` iterations are *opposite* of the
source order.

However, our green tree is strictly source-ordered, so we must deviate from the
Julia AST. We deal with this by grouping cartesian products of iterators
(separated by commas) within `iteration` blocks as in `for` loops, and
use the length of the `iteration` block rather than the `flatten` head to
distinguish flattened iterators. The nested flattens and generators of `Expr`
forms are reconstructed later. In this form the tree structure resembles the
source much more closely. For example, `(xy for x in xs for y in ys)` is parsed as

```
(generator
  xy
  (iteration (in x xs))
  (iteration (in y ys)))
```

And the cartesian iteration `(xy for x in xs, y in ys)` is parsed as

```
(generator
  xy
  (iteration (in x xs) (in y ys)))
```

### Whitespace trivia inside strings

For triple quoted strings, the indentation isn't part of the string data so
should also be excluded from the string content within the green tree. That is,
it should be treated as separate whitespace trivia tokens. With this separation
things like formatting should be much easier. The same reasoning goes for
escaping newlines and following whitespace with backslashes in normal strings.

Detecting string trivia during parsing means that string content is split over
several tokens. Here we wrap these in the K"string" kind (as is already used
for interpolations). The individual chunks can then be reassembled during Expr
construction. (A possible alternative might be to reuse the K"String" and
K"CmdString" kinds for groups of string chunks (without interpolation).)

Take as an example the following Julia fragment.

```julia
x = """
    $a
    b"""
```

Here this is parsed as `(= x (string-s a "\n" "b"))` (the `-s` flag in
`string-s` means "triple quoted string")

Looking at the green tree, we see the indentation before the `$a` and `b` are
marked as trivia:

```
julia> text = "x = \"\"\"\n    \$a\n    b\"\"\""
       show(stdout, MIME"text/plain"(), parseall(GreenNode, text, rule=:statement), text)
     1:23     │[=]
     1:1      │  Identifier             ✔   "x"
     2:2      │  Whitespace                 " "
     3:3      │  =                          "="
     4:4      │  Whitespace                 " "
     5:23     │  [string]
     5:7      │    """                      "\"\"\""
     8:8      │    String                   "\n"
     9:12     │    Whitespace               "    "
    13:13     │    $                        "\$"
    14:14     │    Identifier           ✔   "a"
    15:15     │    String               ✔   "\n"
    16:19     │    Whitespace               "    "
    20:20     │    String               ✔   "b"
    21:23     │    """                      "\"\"\""
```

### String nodes always wrapped in `K"string"` or `K"cmdstring"`

All strings are surrounded by a node of kind `K"string"`, even non-interpolated
literals, so `"x"` parses as `(string "x")`. This makes string handling simpler
and more systematic because interpolations and triple strings with embedded
trivia don't need to be treated differently. It also gives a container in which
to attach the delimiting quotes.

The same goes for command strings which are always wrapped in `K"cmdstring"`
regardless of whether they have multiple pieces (due to triple-quoted
dedenting) or otherwise.

### Do blocks

`do` syntax is represented in the `Expr` AST with the `do` outside the call.
This makes some sense syntactically (do appears as "an operator" after the
function call).

However semantically this nesting is awkward because the lambda represented by
the do block is passed to the call. This same problem occurs for the macro form
`@f(x) do \n body end` where the macro expander needs a special rule to expand
nestings of the form `Expr(:do, Expr(:macrocall ...), ...)`, rearranging the
expression which are passed to this macro call rather than passing the
expressions up the tree.

The implied closure is also lowered to a nested `Expr(:->)` expression, though
it this somewhat premature to do this during parsing.

To resolve these problems we parse

    @f(x, y) do a, b\n body\n end
    f(x, y) do a, b\n body\n end

by tacking the `do` onto the end of the call argument list:

    (macrocall @f x y (do (tuple a b) body))
    (call f x y (do (tuple a b) body))

This achieves the following desirable properties
1. Content of `do` is nested inside the call which improves the match between AST and semantics
2. Macro can be passed the syntax as-is rather than the macro expander rearranging syntax before passing it to the macro
3. In the future, a macro can detect when it's being passed do syntax rather than lambda syntax
4. `do` head is used uniformly for both call and macrocall
5. We preserve the source ordering properties we need for the green tree.

## Tree structure reference

This section may eventually contain a full description of the Julia AST. For
now, we describe a few of the more subtle features.

### Concatenation syntax

Concatenation syntax comes in two syntax forms:
* The traditional `hcat`/`vcat`/`row` which deal with concatenation or matrix
  construction along dimensions one and two.
* The new `ncat`/`nrow` syntax which deals with concatenation or array
  construction along arbitrary dimensions.

We write `ncat-3` for concatenation along the third dimension. (The `3` is
stored in the head flags for `SyntaxNode` trees, and in the first `arg` for
`Expr` trees.) Semantically the new syntax can work like the old:
* `ncat-1` is the same as `vcat`
* `ncat-2` is the same as `hcat`
* `row` is the same as `nrow-2`

#### Vertical concatenation (dimension 1)

Vertical concatenation along dimension 1 can be done with semicolons or newlines

```julia-repl
julia> print_tree(:([a
                     b]))
Expr(:vcat)
├─ :a
└─ :b

julia> print_tree(:([a ; b]))
Expr(:vcat)
├─ :a
└─ :b
```

#### Horizontal concatenation (dimension 2)

For horizontal concatenation along dimension 2, use spaces or double semicolons

```julia-repl
julia> print_tree(:([a b]))
Expr(:hcat)
├─ :a
└─ :b

julia> print_tree(:([a ;; b]))
Expr(:ncat)
├─ 2
├─ :a
└─ :b
```

#### Mixed concatenation

Concatenation along dimensions 1 and 2 can be done with spaces and single
semicolons or newlines, producing a mixture of `vcat` and `row` expressions:

```julia-repl
julia> print_tree(:([a b
                     c d]))
# OR
julia> print_tree(:([a b ; c d]))
Expr(:vcat)
├─ Expr(:row)
│  ├─ :a
│  └─ :b
└─ Expr(:row)
   ├─ :c
   └─ :d
```

General n-dimensional concatenation results in nested `ncat` and `nrow`, for
example

```julia-repl
julia> print_tree(:([a ; b ;; c ; d ;;; x]))
Expr(:ncat)
├─ 3
├─ Expr(:nrow)
│  ├─ 2
│  ├─ Expr(:nrow)
│  │  ├─ 1
│  │  ├─ :a
│  │  └─ :b
│  └─ Expr(:nrow)
│     ├─ 1
│     ├─ :c
│     └─ :d
└─ :x
```
