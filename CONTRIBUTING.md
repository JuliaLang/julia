Hi! Thanks for checking out Julia. If you have questions or problems, the [Julia dev list](https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!forum/julia-dev) is a good place to post them, but you should check out the [online Julia docs](http://docs.julialang.org/en/latest/) first. If you have changes you'd like to contribute, you'll need a [free GitHub account](https://github.com/signup/free). (If you're reading this on GitHub, you probably already have one.) You'll also want a working copy of Julia, built from source (you can still contribute with a binary install, but it's harder and not really recommended). In list form, here's what to do to become a contributor:

* Join the [dev list](https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!forum/julia-dev).

* Create a [GitHub account](https://github.com/signup/free).

* [Fork Julia](https://github.com/JuliaLang/julia/fork_select).

* Build the software and libraries (the first time takes a while, but it's fast after that). Detailed build instructions are in the [README](https://github.com/JuliaLang/julia/tree/master/README.md). Julia depends on several external packages; most are automatically downloaded and installed, but are less frequently updated than Julia itself.

* Keep Julia current. Julia is a fast-moving target, and many details of the language are still settling out. Keep your repository up-to-date and rebase your work in progress frequently.

* Relax and have fun.

## Submitting your contributions

Julia now has a [package manager](https://github.com/JuliaLang/METADATA.jl). Most developers writing julia libraries are encouraged to provide them as a julia package. In case you are contributing to the core functionality or the base libraries, the process is as follows.

The Julia team uses [GitHub issues](https://github.com/JuliaLang/julia/issues) to track and discuss problems, feature requests, and pull requests.

You can make pull requests for incomplete features to get code review. The convention is to prefix the pull request title with "WIP:" for Work In Progress, or "RFC:" for Request for Comments when work is completed and ready for merging. This will prevent accidental merging of work that is in progress.

Before submitting, make sure that all tests pass by running `make testall`. Add your own tests for the new functionality in `test/`. If your contribution includes changes to Makefiles or external dependencies, make sure you can build Julia from a clean tree using `git clean -fdx` or equivalent (be careful â€“ this command will delete any files lying around that aren't checked into git). Make sure that [Travis](http://www.travis-ci.org) greenlights the pull request with a `Good to merge` message.

*By contributing code to Julia, you are agreeing to release it under the [MIT License](https://github.com/JuliaLang/julia/tree/master/LICENSE.md).*

## Getting help

While getting familiar with Julia, remember to check out [the docs](http://docs.julialang.org/en/latest/), keeping in mind that they are [searchable](http://docs.julialang.org/en/latest/search/). (If you use a script blocker then you'll have to unblock that page.) The [source code](https://github.com/JuliaLang/julia) is an excellent source of examples (and it's mostly pretty approachable). If you're still stumped, post something on [the dev list](https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!forum/julia-dev), but you may want to search the archives first to see if there's already been a discussion about what you're stuck on.
