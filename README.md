# ŻbikLang

Forked from [https://github.com/JuliaLang/julia](JuliaLang/julia)

## Installation guide

Just clone

    git clone https://github.com/KMPSUJ/julia-zbik-mode.git

And then

    cd julia-zbik-mode
    make

Welcome to zbikLang

You can run

    ./add_zbik_to_patk.sh

to automatically add `zbik` and `żbik` to $PATH

## Notes

* `make`ing the żbik could take some time. If it failed, run `make clean` and then try to `make` it again.
* żbiklang doesn't replace your original julia installation, you can use them both
* żbik is based on julia 1.10 development version, so it's even julier
