# This test is a bit tricky. It should fail because the first use of
# `[[albums.songs]]` without first declaring `albums` implies that `albums`
# must be a table. The alternative would be quite weird. Namely, it wouldn't
# comply with the TOML spec: "Each double-bracketed sub-table will belong to
# the most *recently* defined table element *above* it."
#
# This is in contrast to the *valid* test, table-array-implicit where
# `[[albums.songs]]` works by itself, so long as `[[albums]]` isn't declared
# later. (Although, `[albums]` could be.)
[[albums.songs]]
name = "Glory Days"

[[albums]]
