# The Julia REPL

Julia comes with a full-featured interactive command-line REPL (read-eval-print loop) built into
the `julia` executable. In addition to allowing quick and easy evaluation of Julia statements,
it has a searchable history, tab-completion, many helpful keybindings, and dedicated help and
shell modes. The REPL can be started by simply calling `julia` with no arguments or double-clicking
on the executable:

```@eval
io = IOBuffer()
Base.banner(io)
banner = String(take!(io))
import Markdown
Markdown.parse("```\n\$ julia\n\n$(banner)\njulia>\n```")
```

To exit the interactive session, type `^D` -- the control key together with the `d` key on a blank
line -- or type `exit()` followed by the return or enter key. The REPL greets you with a banner
and a `julia>` prompt.

## The different prompt modes

### The Julian mode

The REPL has four main modes of operation. The first and most common is the Julian prompt. It
is the default mode of operation; each new line initially starts with `julia>`. It is here that
you can enter Julia expressions. Hitting return or enter after a complete expression has been
entered will evaluate the entry and show the result of the last expression.

```jldoctest
julia> string(1 + 2)
"3"
```

There are a number useful features unique to interactive work. In addition to showing the result,
the REPL also binds the result to the variable `ans`. A trailing semicolon on the line can be
used as a flag to suppress showing the result.

```jldoctest
julia> string(3 * 4);

julia> ans
"12"
```

In Julia mode, the REPL supports something called *prompt pasting*. This activates when pasting
text that starts with `julia> ` into the REPL. In that case, only expressions starting with
`julia> ` are parsed, others are removed. This makes it is possible to paste a chunk of code
that has been copied from a REPL session without having to scrub away prompts and outputs. This
feature is enabled by default but can be disabled or enabled at will with `Base.REPL.enable_promptpaste(::Bool)`.
If it is enabled, you can try it out by pasting the code block above this paragraph straight into
the REPL. This feature does not work on the standard Windows command prompt due to its limitation
at detecting when a paste occurs.

### Help mode

When the cursor is at the beginning of the line, the prompt can be changed to a help mode by typing
`?`. Julia will attempt to print help or documentation for anything entered in help mode:

```julia-repl
julia> ? # upon typing ?, the prompt changes (in place) to: help?>

help?> string
search: string String Cstring Cwstring RevString randstring bytestring SubString

  string(xs...)

  Create a string from any values using the print function.
```

Macros, types and variables can also be queried:

```
help?> @time
  @time

  A macro to execute an expression, printing the time it took to execute, the number of allocations,
  and the total number of bytes its execution caused to be allocated, before returning the value of the
  expression.

  See also @timev, @timed, @elapsed, and @allocated.

help?> Int32
search: Int32 UInt32

  Int32 <: Signed

  32-bit signed integer type.
```

Help mode can be exited by pressing backspace at the beginning of the line.

### [Shell mode](@id man-shell-mode)

Just as help mode is useful for quick access to documentation, another common task is to use the
system shell to execute system commands. Just as `?` entered help mode when at the beginning
of the line, a semicolon (`;`) will enter the shell mode. And it can be exited by pressing backspace
at the beginning of the line.

```julia-repl
julia> ; # upon typing ;, the prompt changes (in place) to: shell>

shell> echo hello
hello
```

### Search modes

In all of the above modes, the executed lines get saved to a history file, which can be searched.
 To initiate an incremental search through the previous history, type `^R` -- the control key
together with the `r` key. The prompt will change to ```(reverse-i-search)`':```, and as you
type the search query will appear in the quotes. The most recent result that matches the query
will dynamically update to the right of the colon as more is typed. To find an older result using
the same query, simply type `^R` again.

Just as `^R` is a reverse search, `^S` is a forward search, with the prompt ```(i-search)`':```.
 The two may be used in conjunction with each other to move through the previous or next matching
results, respectively.

## Key bindings

The Julia REPL makes great use of key bindings. Several control-key bindings were already introduced
above (`^D` to exit, `^R` and `^S` for searching), but there are many more. In addition to the
control-key, there are also meta-key bindings. These vary more by platform, but most terminals
default to using alt- or option- held down with a key to send the meta-key (or can be configured
to do so).

| Keybinding          | Description                                                                                                |

| Page-down, `meta-N` | Change to the next history entry                                                                           |

### Customizing keybindings

Julia's REPL keybindings may be fully customized to a user's preferences by passing a dictionary
to `REPL.setup_interface`. The keys of this dictionary may be characters or strings. The key
`'*'` refers to the default action. Control plus character `x` bindings are indicated with `"^x"`.
Meta plus `x` can be written `"\\Mx"`. The values of the custom keymap must be `nothing` (indicating
that the input should be ignored) or functions that accept the signature `(PromptState, AbstractREPL, Char)`.
The `REPL.setup_interface` function must be called before the REPL is initialized, by registering
the operation with [`atreplinit`](@ref) . For example, to bind the up and down arrow keys to move through
history without prefix search, one could put the following code in `~/.julia/config/startup.jl`:

```julia
import REPL
import REPL.LineEdit

const mykeys = Dict{Any,Any}(
    # Up Arrow
    "\e[A" => (s,o...)->(LineEdit.edit_move_up(s) || LineEdit.history_prev(s, LineEdit.mode(s).hist)),
    # Down Arrow
    "\e[B" => (s,o...)->(LineEdit.edit_move_up(s) || LineEdit.history_next(s, LineEdit.mode(s).hist))
)

function customize_keys(repl)
    repl.interface = REPL.setup_interface(repl; extra_repl_keymap = mykeys)
end

atreplinit(customize_keys)
```

Users should refer to `LineEdit.jl` to discover the available actions on key input.

## Tab completion

In both the Julian and help modes of the REPL, one can enter the first few characters of a function
or type and then press the tab key to get a list all matches:

```julia-repl
julia> stri[TAB]
stride     strides     string      strip

julia> Stri[TAB]
StridedArray    StridedMatrix    StridedVecOrMat  StridedVector    String
```

The tab key can also be used to substitute LaTeX math symbols with their Unicode equivalents,
and get a list of LaTeX matches as well:

```julia-repl
julia> \pi[TAB]
julia> π
π = 3.1415926535897...

julia> e\_1[TAB] = [1,0]
julia> e₁ = [1,0]
2-element Array{Int64,1}:
 1
 0

julia> e\^1[TAB] = [1 0]
julia> e¹ = [1 0]
1×2 Array{Int64,2}:
 1  0

julia> \sqrt[TAB]2     # √ is equivalent to the sqrt function
julia> √2
1.4142135623730951

julia> \hbar[TAB](h) = h / 2\pi[TAB]
julia> ħ(h) = h / 2π
ħ (generic function with 1 method)

julia> \h[TAB]
\hat              \hermitconjmatrix  \hkswarow          \hrectangle
\hatapprox        \hexagon           \hookleftarrow     \hrectangleblack
\hbar             \hexagonblack      \hookrightarrow    \hslash
\heartsuit        \hksearow          \house             \hspace

julia> α="\alpha[TAB]"   # LaTeX completion also works in strings
julia> α="α"
```

A full list of tab-completions can be found in the [Unicode Input](@ref) section of the manual.

Completion of paths works for strings and julia's shell mode:

```julia-repl
julia> path="/[TAB]"
.dockerenv  .juliabox/   boot/        etc/         lib/         media/       opt/         root/        sbin/        sys/         usr/
.dockerinit bin/         dev/         home/        lib64/       mnt/         proc/        run/         srv/         tmp/         var/
shell> /[TAB]
.dockerenv  .juliabox/   boot/        etc/         lib/         media/       opt/         root/        sbin/        sys/         usr/
.dockerinit bin/         dev/         home/        lib64/       mnt/         proc/        run/         srv/         tmp/         var/
```

Tab completion can help with investigation of the available methods matching the input arguments:

```julia-repl
julia> max([TAB] # All methods are displayed, not shown here due to size of the list

julia> max([1, 2], [TAB] # All methods where `Vector{Int}` matches as first argument
max(x, y) in Base at operators.jl:215
max(a, b, c, xs...) in Base at operators.jl:281

julia> max([1, 2], max(1, 2), [TAB] # All methods matching the arguments.
max(x, y) in Base at operators.jl:215
max(a, b, c, xs...) in Base at operators.jl:281
```

Keywords are also displayed in the suggested methods after `;`, see below line where `limit`
and `keepempty` are keyword arguments:

```julia-repl
julia> split("1 1 1", [TAB]
split(str::AbstractString; limit, keepempty) in Base at strings/util.jl:302
split(str::T, splitter; limit, keepempty) where T<:AbstractString in Base at strings/util.jl:277
```

The completion of the methods uses type inference and can therefore see if the arguments match
even if the arguments are output from functions. The function needs to be type stable for the
completion to be able to remove non-matching methods.

Tab completion can also help completing fields:

```julia-repl
julia> import UUIDs

julia> UUIDs.uuid[TAB]
uuid1        uuid4         uuid_version
```

Fields for output from functions can also be completed:

```julia-repl
julia> split("","")[1].[TAB]
lastindex  offset  string
```

The completion of fields for output from functions uses type inference, and it can only suggest
fields if the function is type stable.

## Customizing Colors

The colors used by Julia and the REPL can be customized, as well. To change the
color of the Julia prompt you can add something like the following to your
`~/.julia/config/startup.jl` file, which is to be placed inside your home directory:

```julia
function customize_colors(repl)
    repl.prompt_color = Base.text_colors[:cyan]
end

atreplinit(customize_colors)
```

The available color keys can be seen by typing `Base.text_colors` in the help mode of the REPL.
In addition, the integers 0 to 255 can be used as color keys for terminals
with 256 color support.

You can also change the colors for the help and shell prompts and
input and answer text by setting the appropriate field of `repl` in the `customize_colors` function
above (respectively, `help_color`, `shell_color`, `input_color`, and `answer_color`). For the
latter two, be sure that the `envcolors` field is also set to false.

It is also possible to apply boldface formatting by using
`Base.text_colors[:bold]` as a color. For instance, to print answers in
boldface font, one can use the following as a `~/.julia/config/startup.jl`:

```julia
function customize_colors(repl)
    repl.envcolors = false
    repl.answer_color = Base.text_colors[:bold]
end

atreplinit(customize_colors)
```

You can also customize the color used to render warning and informational messages by
setting the appropriate environment variables. For instance, to render error, warning, and informational
messages respectively in magenta, yellow, and cyan you can add the following to your
`~/.julia/config/startup.jl` file:

```julia
ENV["JULIA_ERROR_COLOR"] = :magenta
ENV["JULIA_WARN_COLOR"] = :yellow
ENV["JULIA_INFO_COLOR"] = :cyan
```

# TerminalMenus

TerminalMenus is a submodule of the Julia REPL and enables small, low-profile interactive menus in the terminal.

## Examples

```julia
import REPL
using REPL.TerminalMenus

options = ["apple", "orange", "grape", "strawberry",
            "blueberry", "peach", "lemon", "lime"]

```

### RadioMenu

The RadioMenu allows the user to select one option from the list. The `request`
function displays the interactive menu and returns the index of the selected
choice. If a user presses 'q' or `ctrl-c`, `request` will return a `-1`.


```julia
# `pagesize` is the number of items to be displayed at a time.
#  The UI will scroll if the number of options is greater
#   than the `pagesize`
menu = RadioMenu(options, pagesize=4)

# `request` displays the menu and returns the index after the
#   user has selected a choice
choice = request("Choose your favorite fruit:", menu)

if choice != -1
    println("Your favorite fruit is ", options[choice], "!")
else
    println("Menu canceled.")
end

```

Output:

```
Choose your favorite fruit:
^  grape
   strawberry
 > blueberry
v  peach
Your favorite fruit is blueberry!
```

### MultiSelectMenu

The MultiSelectMenu allows users to select many choices from a list.

```julia
# here we use the default `pagesize` 10
menu = MultiSelectMenu(options)

# `request` returns a `Set` of selected indices
# if the menu us canceled (ctrl-c or q), return an empty set
choices = request("Select the fruits you like:", menu)

if length(choices) > 0
    println("You like the following fruits:")
    for i in choices
        println("  - ", options[i])
    end
else
    println("Menu canceled.")
end
```

Output:

```
Select the fruits you like:
[press: d=done, a=all, n=none]
   [ ] apple
 > [X] orange
   [X] grape
   [ ] strawberry
   [ ] blueberry
   [X] peach
   [ ] lemon
   [ ] lime
You like the following fruits:
  - orange
  - grape
  - peach
```

## Customization / Configuration

All interface customization is done through the keyword only
`TerminalMenus.config()` function.

### Arguments

 - `charset::Symbol=:na`: ui characters to use (`:ascii` or `:unicode`); overridden by other arguments
 - `cursor::Char='>'|'→'`: character to use for cursor
 - `up_arrow::Char='^'|'↑'`: character to use for up arrow
 - `down_arrow::Char='v'|'↓'`: character to use for down arrow
 - `checked::String="[X]"|"✓"`: string to use for checked
 - `unchecked::String="[ ]"|"⬚")`: string to use for unchecked
 - `scroll::Symbol=:na`: If `:wrap` then wrap the cursor around top and bottom, if :`nowrap` do not wrap cursor
 - `supress_output::Bool=false`: For testing. If true, menu will not be printed to console.
 - `ctrl_c_interrupt::Bool=true`: If `false`, return empty on ^C, if `true` throw InterruptException() on ^C

### Examples

```julia
julia> menu = MultiSelectMenu(options, pagesize=5);

julia> request(menu) # ASCII is used by default
[press: d=done, a=all, n=none]
   [ ] apple
   [X] orange
   [ ] grape
 > [X] strawberry
v  [ ] blueberry
Set([4, 2])

julia> TerminalMenus.config(charset=:unicode)

julia> request(menu)
[press: d=done, a=all, n=none]
   ⬚ apple
   ✓ orange
   ⬚ grape
 → ✓ strawberry
↓  ⬚ blueberry
Set([4, 2])

julia> TerminalMenus.config(checked="YEP!", unchecked="NOPE", cursor='⧐')

julia> request(menu)
[press: d=done, a=all, n=none]
   NOPE apple
   YEP! orange
   NOPE grape
 ⧐ YEP! strawberry
↓  NOPE blueberry
