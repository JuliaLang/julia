`probe_platform_engines!(;verbose::Bool = false)`

Searches the environment for various tools needed to download, unpack, and
package up binaries.  Searches for a download engine to be used by
`gen_download_cmd()` and a compression engine to be used by `gen_unpack_cmd()`,
`gen_package_cmd()`, `gen_list_tarball_cmd()` and `parse_tarball_listing()`.
Running this function
will set the global functions to their appropriate implementations given the
environment this package is running on.

This probing function will automatically search for download engines using a
particular ordering; if you wish to override this ordering and use one over all
others, set the `BINARYPROVIDER_DOWNLOAD_ENGINE` environment variable to its
name, and it will be the only engine searched for. For example, put:

    ENV["BINARYPROVIDER_DOWNLOAD_ENGINE"] = "fetch"

within your `~/.juliarc.jl` file to force `fetch` to be used over `curl`.  If
the given override does not match any of the download engines known to this
function, a warning will be printed and the typical ordering will be performed.

Similarly, if you wish to override the compression engine used, set the
`BINARYPROVIDER_COMPRESSION_ENGINE` environment variable to its name (e.g. `7z`
or `tar`) and it will be the only engine searched for.  If the given override
does not match any of the compression engines known to this function, a warning
will be printed and the typical searching will be performed.

If `verbose` is `true`, print out the various engines as they are searched.
