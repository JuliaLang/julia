# Random Numbers

```@meta
DocTestSetup = :(using Random)
```

Random number generation in Julia uses the [Mersenne Twister library](http://www.math.sci.hiroshima-u.ac.jp/~m-mat/MT/SFMT/#dSFMT)
via `MersenneTwister` objects. Julia has a global RNG, which is used by default. Other RNG types
can be plugged in by inheriting the `AbstractRNG` type; they can then be used to have multiple
streams of random numbers. Besides `MersenneTwister`, Julia also provides the `RandomDevice` RNG
type, which is a wrapper over the OS provided entropy.

Most functions related to random generation accept an optional `AbstractRNG` object as first argument,
which defaults to the global one if not provided. Moreover, some of them accept optionally
dimension specifications `dims...` (which can be given as a tuple) to generate arrays of random
values.

A `MersenneTwister` or `RandomDevice` RNG can generate uniformly random numbers of the following types:
[`Float16`](@ref), [`Float32`](@ref), [`Float64`](@ref), [`BigFloat`](@ref), [`Bool`](@ref),
[`Int8`](@ref), [`UInt8`](@ref), [`Int16`](@ref), [`UInt16`](@ref), [`Int32`](@ref),
[`UInt32`](@ref), [`Int64`](@ref), [`UInt64`](@ref), [`Int128`](@ref), [`UInt128`](@ref),
[`BigInt`](@ref) (or complex numbers of those types).
Random floating point numbers are generated uniformly in ``[0, 1)``. As `BigInt` represents
unbounded integers, the interval must be specified (e.g. `rand(big.(1:6))`).

Additionally, normal and exponential distributions are implemented for some `AbstractFloat` and
`Complex` types, see [`randn`](@ref) and [`randexp`](@ref) for details.

## Hooking into the `Random` API

There are two mostly orthogonal ways to extend `Random` functionalities:
1) generating random values of custom types
2) creating new generators

The API for 1) is quite functional, but is relatively recent so it may still have to evolve in subsequent releases of the `Random` module.
For example, it's typically sufficient to implement one `rand` method in order to have all other usual methods work automatically.

The API for 2) is still rudimentary, and may require more work than strictly necessary from the implementor,
in order to support usual types of generated values.

### Generating random values of custom types

There are two categories: generating values from a type (e.g. `rand(Int)`), or from a collection (e.g. `rand(1:3)`).
The simple cases are explained first, and more advanced usage is presented later.
We assume here that the choice of algorithm is independent of the RNG, so we use `AbstractRNG` in our signatures.

#### Generating values from a type

Given a type `T`, it's currently assumed that if `rand(T)` is defined, an object of type `T` will be produced.
In order to define random generation of values of type `T`, the following method can be defined:
`rand(rng::AbstractRNG, ::Random.SamplerType{T})` (this should return what `rand(rng, T)` is expected to return).

Let's take the following example: we implement a `Die` type, with a variable number `n` of sides, numbered from `1` to `n`.
We want `rand(Die)` to produce a die with a random number of up to 20 sides (and at least 4):

```jldoctest Die
struct Die
    nsides::Int # number of sides
end

Random.rand(rng::AbstractRNG, ::Random.SamplerType{Die}) = Die(rand(rng, 4:20))

# output

```

Scalar and array methods for `Die` now work as expected:

```jldoctest Die; setup = :(Random.seed!(1))
julia> rand(Die)
Die(18)

julia> rand(MersenneTwister(0), Die)
Die(4)

julia> rand(Die, 3)
3-element Array{Die,1}:
 Die(6)
 Die(11)
 Die(5)

julia> a = Vector{Die}(undef, 3); rand!(a)
3-element Array{Die,1}:
 Die(18)
 Die(6)
 Die(8)
```

#### Generating values from a collection

Given a collection type `S`, it's currently assumed that if `rand(::S)` is defined, an object of type `eltype(S)` will be produced.
In order to define random generation out of objects of type `S`, the following method can be defined:
`rand(rng::AbstractRNG, sp::Random.SamplerTrivial{S})`. Here, `sp` simply wraps an object of type `S`, which can be accessed via `sp[]`.
Continuing the `Die` example, we want now to define `rand(d::Die)` to produce an `Int` corresponding to one of `d`'s sides:

```jldoctest Die; setup = :(Random.seed!(1))
julia> Random.rand(rng::AbstractRNG, d::Random.SamplerTrivial{Die}) = rand(rng, 1:d[].nsides);

julia> rand(Die(4))
3

julia> rand(Die(4), 3)
3-element Array{Any,1}:
 3
 4
 2
```

In the last example, a `Vector{Any}` is produced; the reason is that `eltype(Die) == Any`. The remedy is to define
`Base.eltype(::Type{Die}) = Int`.


#### Generating values for an `AbstractFloat` type

`AbstractFloat` types are special-cased, because by default random values are not produced in the whole type domain, but rather
in `[0,1)`. The following method should be implemented for `T <: AbstractFloat`:
`Random.rand(::AbstractRNG, ::Random.SamplerTrivial{Random.CloseOpen01{T}})`


#### Optimizing generation with cached computation between calls

When repeatedly generating random values (with the same `rand` parameters), it happens for some types
that the result of a computation is used for each call. In this case, the computation can be decoupled
from actually generating the values. This is the case for example with the default implementation for
`AbstractArray`. Assume that `rand(rng, 1:20)` has to be called repeatedly in a loop: the way to take advantage
of this decoupling is as follows:

```julia
rng = MersenneTwister()
sp = Random.Sampler(rng, 1:20) # or Random.Sampler(MersenneTwister,1:20)
for x in X
    n = rand(rng, sp) # similar to n = rand(rng, 1:20)
    # use n
end
```

This mechanism is of course used by the default implementation of random array generation (like in `rand(1:20, 10)`).
In order to implement this decoupling for a custom type, a helper type can be used.
Going back to our `Die` example: `rand(::Die)` uses random generation from a range, so
there is an opportunity for this optimization:

```julia
import Random: Sampler, rand

struct SamplerDie <: Sampler{Int} # generates values of type Int
    die::Die
    sp::Sampler{Int} # this is an abstract type, so this could be improved
end

Sampler(RNG::Type{<:AbstractRNG}, die::Die, r::Random.Repetition) =
    SamplerDie(die, Sampler(RNG, 1:die.nsides, r))
# the `r` parameter will be explained later on

rand(rng::AbstractRNG, sp::SamplerDie) = rand(rng, sp.sp)
```

It's now possible to get a sampler with `sp = Sampler(rng, die)`, and use `sp` instead of `die` in any `rand` call involving `rng`.
In the simplistic example above, `die` doesn't need to be stored in `SamplerDie` but this is often the case in practice.

This pattern is so frequent that a helper type named `Random.SamplerSimple` is available,
saving us the definition of `SamplerDie`: we could have implemented our decoupling with:

```julia
Sampler(RNG::Type{<:AbstractRNG}, die::Die, r::Random.Repetition) =
    SamplerSimple(die, Sampler(RNG, 1:die.nsides, r))

rand(rng::AbstractRNG, sp::SamplerSimple{Die}) = rand(rng, sp.data)
```

Here, `sp.data` refers to the second parameter in the call to the `SamplerSimple` constructor
(in this case equal to `Sampler(rng, 1:die.nsides, r)`), while the `Die` object can be accessed
via `sp[]`.

Another helper type is currently available for other cases, `Random.SamplerTag`, but is
considered as internal API, and can break at any time without proper deprecations.


#### Using distinct algorithms for scalar or array generation

In some cases, whether one wants to generate only a handful of values or a large number of values
will have an impact on the choice of algorithm. This is handled with the third parameter of the
`Sampler` constructor. Let's assume we defined two helper types for `Die`, say `SamplerDie1`
which should be used to generate only few random values, and `SamplerDieMany` for many values.
We can use those types as follows:

```julia
Sampler(RNG::Type{<:AbstractRNG}, die::Die, ::Val{1}) = SamplerDie1(...)
Sampler(RNG::Type{<:AbstractRNG}, die::Die, ::Val{Inf}) = SamplerDieMany(...)
```

Of course, `rand` must also be defined on those types (i.e. `rand(::AbstractRNG, ::SamplerDie1)`
and `rand(::AbstractRNG, ::SamplerDieMany)`).

Note: `Sampler(rng, x)` is simply a shorthand for `Sampler(rng, x, Val(Inf))`, and
`Random.Repetition` is an alias for `Union{Val{1}, Val{Inf}}`.


### Creating new generators

The API is not clearly defined yet, but as a rule of thumb:
1) any `rand` method producing "basic" types (`isbitstype` integer and floating types in `Base`)
   should be defined for this specific RNG, if they are needed;
2) other documented `rand` methods accepting an `AbstractRNG` should work out of the box,
   (provided the methods from 1) what are relied on are implemented),
   but can of course be specialized for this RNG if there is room for optimization.

Concerning 1), a `rand` method may happen to work automatically, but it's not officially
supported and may break without warnings in a subsequent release.

To define a new `rand` method for an hypothetical `MyRNG` generator, and a value specification `s`
(e.g. `s == Int`, or `s == 1:10`) of type `S==typeof(s)` or `S==Type{s}` if `s` is a type,
the same two methods as we saw before must be defined:

1) `Sampler(::Type{MyRNG}, ::S, ::Repetition)`, which returns an object of type say `SamplerS`
2) `rand(rng::MyRNG, sp::SamplerS)`

It can happen that `Sampler(rng::AbstractRNG, ::S, ::Repetition)` is
already defined in the `Random` module. It would then be possible to
skip step 1) in practice (if one wants to specialize generation for
this particular RNG type), but the corresponding `SamplerS` type is
considered as internal detail, and may be changed without warning.


#### Specializing array generation

In some cases, for a given RNG type, generating an array of random
values can be more efficient with a specialized method than by merely
using the decoupling technique explained before. This is for example
the case for `MersenneTwister`, which natively writes random values in
an array.

To implement this specialization for `MyRNG`
and for a specification `s`, producing elements of type `S`,
the following method can be defined:
`rand!(rng::MyRNG, a::AbstractArray{S}, ::SamplerS)`,
where `SamplerS` is the type of the sampler returned by `Sampler(MyRNG, s, Val(Inf))`.
Instead of `AbstractArray`, it's possible to implement the functionality only for a subtype, e.g. `Array{S}`.
The non-mutating array method of `rand` will automatically call this specialization internally.
