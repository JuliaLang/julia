`@write_deps_file(products...)`

Helper macro to generate a `deps.jl` file out of a mapping of variable name
to  `Product` objects. Call using something like:

    fooifier = ExecutableProduct(...)
    libbar = LibraryProduct(...)
    @write_deps_file fooifier libbar

If any `Product` object cannot be satisfied (e.g. `LibraryProduct` objects must
be `dlopen()`-able, `FileProduct` objects must exist on the filesystem, etc...)
this macro will error out.  Ensure that you have used `install()` to install
the binaries you wish to write a `deps.jl` file for, and, optionally that you
have used `activate()` on the `Prefix` in which the binaries were installed so
as to make sure that the binaries are locatable.

The result of this macro call is a `deps.jl` file containing variables named
the same as the keys of the passed-in dictionary, holding the full path to the
installed binaries.  Given the example above, it would contain code similar to:

    global const fooifier = "<pkg path>/deps/usr/bin/fooifier"
    global const libbar = "<pkg path>/deps/usr/lib/libbar.so"

This file is intended to be `include()`'ed from within the `__init__()` method
of your package.  Note that all files are checked for consistency on package
load time, and if an error is discovered, package loading will fail, asking
the user to re-run `Pkg.build("package_name")`.
