"""
A `BinaryPackage` collects all the information needed to download and install a
tarball containing binary objects; it has the `url` to download form, the
`hash` to verify package integrity, a list of `products` to check for proper
functioning after installation, and a list of `dependencies` that must also be
installed before this package can be used.

There exist `install()`, `uninstall()` and `satisfied()` methods for
`BinaryPackage` objects, similar to the lower-level versions that take direct
`url` and `hash` arguments.
