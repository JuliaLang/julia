# The name/uuid mapping of a package is recorded when a compatibility entry
# is created. This is only used to decode the package names below and does
# not need to match the name used in Config.toml or Manifest.toml, nor do
# they need to be updated later if those change for any reason. They may be
# updated, however, for clarity.

# A key-value pair in a broken/fixed stanza is satisfied if the named package
# on the LHS is checked out at a commit that is a descendant of the commit on
# the RHS. A broken/fixed stanza is satisfied if all of its key-value pairs
# are satisfied. If the value of "broken" or "fixed" is a single stanza (i.e.
# a dict) then it is satisfied if that stanza is. If a "broken" or "fixed"
# entry is an array, then it is satisfied if any of its stanzas are satisfied.
# A set of package versions is considered "broken" if the "broken" entry is
# satisfied but the "fixed" entry is not satisfied.
