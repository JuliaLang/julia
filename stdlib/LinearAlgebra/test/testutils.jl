# Test approximate equality of vectors or columns of matrices modulo floating
# point roundoff and phase (sign) differences.
#
# This function is designed to test for equality between vectors of floating point
# numbers when the vectors are defined only up to a global phase or sign, such as
# normalized eigenvectors or singular vectors. The global phase is usually
# defined consistently, but may occasionally change due to small differences in
# floating point rounding noise or rounding modes, or through the use of
# different conventions in different algorithms. As a result, most tests checking
# such vectors have to detect and discard such overall phase differences.
#
# Inputs:
#     a, b:: StridedVecOrMat to be compared
#     err :: Default: m^3*(eps(S)+eps(T)), where m is the number of rows
#
# Raises an error if any columnwise vector norm exceeds err. Otherwise, returns
# nothing.
