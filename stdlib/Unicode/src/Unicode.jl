    Unicode.normalize(s::AbstractString, normalform::Symbol)

Normalize the string `s` according to one of the four "normal forms" of the Unicode
standard: `normalform` can be `:NFC`, `:NFD`, `:NFKC`, or `:NFKD`.  Normal forms C
(canonical composition) and D (canonical decomposition) convert different visually identical
representations of the same abstract string into a single canonical form, with form C being
more compact.  Normal forms KC and KD additionally canonicalize "compatibility equivalents":
they convert characters that are abstractly similar but visually distinct into a single
canonical choice (e.g. they expand ligatures into the individual characters), with form KC
being more compact.

Alternatively, finer control and additional transformations may be obtained by calling
`Unicode.normalize(s; keywords...)`, where any number of the following boolean keywords
options (which all default to `false` except for `compose`) are specified:

* `compose=false`: do not perform canonical composition
* `decompose=true`: do canonical decomposition instead of canonical composition
  (`compose=true` is ignored if present)
* `compat=true`: compatibility equivalents are canonicalized
* `casefold=true`: perform Unicode case folding, e.g. for case-insensitive string comparison
* `newline2lf=true`, `newline2ls=true`, or `newline2ps=true`: convert various newline
  sequences (LF, CRLF, CR, NEL) into a linefeed (LF), line-separation (LS), or
  paragraph-separation (PS) character, respectively
* `stripmark=true`: strip diacritical marks (e.g. accents)
* `stripignore=true`: strip Unicode's "default ignorable" characters (e.g. the soft hyphen
  or the left-to-right marker)
* `stripcc=true`: strip control characters; horizontal tabs and form feeds are converted to
  spaces; newlines are also converted to spaces unless a newline-conversion flag was
  specified
* `rejectna=true`: throw an error if unassigned code points are found
* `stable=true`: enforce Unicode Versioning Stability

For example, NFKC corresponds to the options `compose=true, compat=true, stable=true`.

```jldoctest
julia> "μ" == Unicode.normalize("µ", compat=true) #LHS: Unicode U+03bc, RHS: Unicode U+00b5
true

julia> Unicode.normalize("JuLiA", casefold=true)
"julia"

julia> Unicode.normalize("JúLiA", stripmark=true)
"JuLiA"

    Unicode.isassigned(c) -> Bool

    graphemes(s::AbstractString) -> GraphemeIterator

Returns an iterator over substrings of `s` that correspond to the extended graphemes in the
string, as defined by Unicode UAX #29. (Roughly, these are what users would perceive as
single characters, even though they may contain more than one codepoint; for example a
letter combined with an accent mark is a single grapheme.)
