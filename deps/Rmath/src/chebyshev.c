 *  SYNOPSIS
 *
 *    int chebyshev_init(double *dos, int nos, double eta)
 *    double chebyshev_eval(double x, double *a, int n)
 *
 *  DESCRIPTION
 *
 *    "chebyshev_init" determines the number of terms for the
 *    double precision orthogonal series "dos" needed to insure
 *    the error is no larger than "eta".  Ordinarily eta will be
 *    chosen to be one-tenth machine precision.
 *
 *    "chebyshev_eval" evaluates the n-term Chebyshev series
 *    "a" at "x".
 *
 *  NOTES
 *
 *    These routines are translations into C of Fortran routines
 *    by W. Fullerton of Los Alamos Scientific Laboratory.
 *
 *    Based on the Fortran routine dcsevl by W. Fullerton.
 *    Adapted from R. Broucke, Algorithm 446, CACM., 16, 254 (1973).
