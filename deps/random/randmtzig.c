   A C-program for MT19937, with initialization improved 2002/2/10.
   Coded by Takuji Nishimura and Makoto Matsumoto.
   This is a faster version by taking Shawn Cokus's optimization,
   Matthe Bellew's simplification, Isaku Wada's real version.
   David Bateman added normal and exponential distributions following
   Marsaglia and Tang's Ziggurat algorithm.

/*
This code is based on the paper Marsaglia and Tsang, "The ziggurat method
for generating random variables", Journ. Statistical Software. Code was
presented in this paper for a Ziggurat of 127 levels and using a 32 bit
integer random number generator. This version of the code, uses the
Mersenne Twister as the integer generator and uses 256 levels in the
Ziggurat. This has several advantages.

  1) As Marsaglia and Tsang themselves states, the more levels the few
     times the expensive tail algorithm must be called
  2) The cycle time of the generator is determined by the integer
     generator, thus the use of a Mersenne Twister for the core random
     generator makes this cycle extremely long.
  3) The license on the original code was unclear, thus rewriting the code
     from the article means we are free of copyright issues.
  4) Compile flag for full 53-bit random mantissa.

It should be stated that the authors made my life easier, by the fact that
the algorithm developed in the text of the article is for a 256 level
ziggurat, even if the code itself isn't...

One modification to the algorithm developed in the article, is that it is
assumed that 0 <= x < Inf, and "unsigned long"s are used, thus resulting in
terms like 2^32 in the code. As the normal distribution is defined between
-Inf < x < Inf, we effectively only have 31 bit integers plus a sign. Thus
in Marsaglia and Tsang, terms like 2^32 become 2^31. We use NMANTISSA for
this term.  The exponential distribution is one sided so we use the
full 32 bits.  We use EMANTISSA for this term.

It appears that I'm slightly slower than the code in the article, this
is partially due to a better generator of random integers than they
use. But might also be that the case of rapid return was optimized by
inlining the relevant code with a #define. As the basic Mersenne
Twister is only 25% faster than this code I suspect that the main
reason is just the use of the Mersenne Twister and not the inlining,
so I'm not going to try and optimize further.
