    AbstractChannel{T}

Representation of a channel passing objects of type `T`.
"""
abstract type AbstractChannel{T} end

"""
    Channel{T=Any}(size::Int=0)

Constructs a `Channel` with an internal buffer that can hold a maximum of `size` objects
of type `T`.
[`put!`](@ref) calls on a full channel block until an object is removed with [`take!`](@ref).

`Channel(0)` constructs an unbuffered channel. `put!` blocks until a matching `take!` is called.
And vice-versa.

Other constructors:

* `Channel()`: default constructor, equivalent to `Channel{Any}(0)`
* `Channel(Inf)`: equivalent to `Channel{Any}(typemax(Int))`
* `Channel(sz)`: equivalent to `Channel{Any}(sz)`

!!! compat "Julia 1.3"
  The default constructor `Channel()` and default `size=0` were added in Julia 1.3.

    Channel{T=Any}(func::Function, size=0; taskref=nothing)

Create a new task from `func`, bind it to a new channel of type
`T` and size `size`, and schedule the task, all in a single call.

`func` must accept the bound channel as its only argument.

If you need a reference to the created task, pass a `Ref{Task}` object via
the keyword argument `taskref`.

Return a `Channel`.

# Examples
```jldoctest
julia> chnl = Channel() do ch
           foreach(i -> put!(ch, i), 1:4)
       end;

julia> typeof(chnl)
Channel{Any}

julia> for i in chnl
           @show i
       end;
i = 1
i = 2
i = 3
i = 4
```

Referencing the created task:

```jldoctest
julia> taskref = Ref{Task}();

julia> chnl = Channel(taskref=taskref) do ch
           println(take!(ch))
       end;

julia> istaskdone(taskref[])
false

julia> put!(chnl, "Hello");
Hello

julia> istaskdone(taskref[])

!!! compat "Julia 1.3"
  This constructor was added in Julia 1.3. Earlier versions of Julia used kwargs
  to set `size` and `T`, but those constructors are deprecated.

    bind(chnl::Channel, task::Task)

Associate the lifetime of `chnl` with a task.
`Channel` `chnl` is automatically closed when the task terminates.
Any uncaught exception in the task is propagated to all waiters on `chnl`.

The `chnl` object can be explicitly closed independent of task termination.
Terminating tasks have no effect on already closed `Channel` objects.

When a channel is bound to multiple tasks, the first task to terminate will
close the channel. When multiple channels are bound to the same task,
termination of the task will close all of the bound channels.
