- `cpu_times!nice::UInt64`: Time spent in nice mode. CPU state is a subset of the "user" state and shows the CPU time used by processes that have a positive niceness, meaning a lower priority than other tasks.
- `cpu_times!sys::UInt64`: Time spent in system mode. CPU state shows the amount of CPU time used by the kernel.
- `cpu_times!idle::UInt64`: Time spent in idle mode. CPU state shows the CPU time that's not actively being used.
- `cpu_times!irq::UInt64`: Time spent handling interrupts. CPU state shows the amount of time the CPU has been servicing hardware interrupts.

The times are in units of `1/Sys.SC_CLK_TCK` seconds if `Sys.SC_CLK_TCK > 0`; otherwise they are in
unknown units.
