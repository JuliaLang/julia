    macroexpand(m::Module, x; recursive=true)

Take the expression `x` and return an equivalent expression with all macros removed (expanded)
for executing in module `m`.
The `recursive` keyword controls whether deeper levels of nested macros are also expanded.
This is demonstrated in the example below:
```julia-repl
julia> module M
           macro m1()
               42
           end
           macro m2()

       end

```

        ccall(:jl_macroexpand1, Any, (Any, Any), x, m)
    end
end

"""
    @macroexpand

Return equivalent expression with all macros removed (expanded).

There are differences between `@macroexpand` and [`macroexpand`](@ref).

* While [`macroexpand`](@ref) takes a keyword argument `recursive`, `@macroexpand`
  is always recursive. For a non recursive macro version, see [`@macroexpand1`](@ref).

* While [`macroexpand`](@ref) has an explicit `module` argument, `@macroexpand` always
  expands with respect to the module in which it is called.

This is best seen in the following example:
```julia-repl
julia> module M
           macro m()
               1
           end
           function f()
               (@macroexpand(@m),
                macroexpand(M, :(@m)),
                macroexpand(Main, :(@m))
               )
           end
       end
M

julia> macro m()
           2
       end
@m (macro with 1 method)

julia> M.f()
(1, 1, 2)
```
With `@macroexpand` the expression expands where `@macroexpand` appears in the code (module `M` in the example).
With `macroexpand` the expression expands in the module given as the first argument.

    @inline

Give a hint to the compiler that this function is worth inlining.

Small functions typically do not need the `@inline` annotation,
as the compiler does it automatically. By using `@inline` on bigger functions,
an extra nudge can be given to the compiler to inline it.

`@inline` can be applied immediately before the definition or in its function body.

```julia
# annotate long-form definition
@inline function longdef(x)
    ...
end

# annotate short-form definition
@inline shortdef(x) = ...

# annotate anonymous function that a `do` block creates
f() do
    @inline
    ...
end
```

!!! compat "Julia 1.8"
    The usage within a function body requires at least Julia 1.8.

---
    @inline block

Give a hint to the compiler that calls within `block` are worth inlining.

```julia
# The compiler will try to inline `f`
@inline f(...)

# The compiler will try to inline `f`, `g` and `+`
@inline f(...) + g(...)
```

!!! note
    A callsite annotation always has the precedence over the annotation applied to the
    definition of the called function:
    ```julia
    @noinline function explicit_noinline(args...)
        # body
    end

    let
        @inline explicit_noinline(args...) # will be inlined
    end
    ```

!!! note
    When there are nested callsite annotations, the innermost annotation has the precedence:
    ```julia
    @noinline let a0, b0 = ...
        a = @inline f(a0)  # the compiler will try to inline this call
        b = f(b0)          # the compiler will NOT try to inline this call
        return a, b
    end
    ```

!!! warning
    Although a callsite annotation will try to force inlining in regardless of the cost model,
    there are still chances it can't succeed in it. Especially, recursive calls can not be
    inlined even if they are annotated as `@inline`d.

```

!!! warning
    Improper use of this macro causes undefined behavior (including crashes,
    incorrect answers, or other hard to track bugs). Use with care and only if
    absolutely required.

In general, each `setting` value makes an assertion about the behavior of the
function, without requiring the compiler to prove that this behavior is indeed
true. These assertions are made for all world ages. It is thus advisable to limit
the use of generic functions that may later be extended to invalidate the
assumption (which would cause undefined behavior).

The following `setting`s are supported.
- `:consistent`
- `:effect_free`
- `:nothrow`
- `:terminates_globally`
- `:terminates_locally`
- `:notaskstate`
- `:foldable`
- `:total`

---
# `:consistent`

The `:consistent` setting asserts that for egal (`===`) inputs:
- The manner of termination (return value, exception, non-termination) will always be the same.
- If the method returns, the results will always be egal.

!!! note
    This in particular implies that the return value of the method must be
    immutable. Multiple allocations of mutable objects (even with identical
    contents) are not egal.

!!! note
    The `:consistent`-cy assertion is made world-age wise. More formally, write
    ``fᵢ`` for the evaluation of ``f`` in world-age ``i``, then we require:
    ```math
    ∀ i, x, y: x ≡ y → fᵢ(x) ≡ fᵢ(y)
    ```
    However, for two world ages ``i``, ``j`` s.t. ``i ≠ j``, we may have ``fᵢ(x) ≢ fⱼ(y)``.

    A further implication is that `:consistent` functions may not make their
    return value dependent on the state of the heap or any other global state
    that is not constant for a given world age.

!!! note
    The `:consistent`-cy includes all legal rewrites performed by the optimizer.
    For example, floating-point fastmath operations are not considered `:consistent`,
    because the optimizer may rewrite them causing the output to not be `:consistent`,
    even for the same world age (e.g. because one ran in the interpreter, while
    the other was optimized).

!!! note
    If `:consistent` functions terminate by throwing an exception, that exception
    itself is not required to meet the egality requirement specified above.

---
# `:effect_free`

The `:effect_free` setting asserts that the method is free of externally semantically
visible side effects. The following is an incomplete list of externally semantically
visible side effects:
- Changing the value of a global variable.
- Mutating the heap (e.g. an array or mutable value), except as noted below
- Changing the method table (e.g. through calls to eval)
- File/Network/etc. I/O
- Task switching

However, the following are explicitly not semantically visible, even if they
may be observable:
- Memory allocations (both mutable and immutable)
- Elapsed time
- Garbage collection
- Heap mutations of objects whose lifetime does not exceed the method (i.e.
  were allocated in the method and do not escape).
- The returned value (which is externally visible, but not a side effect)

The rule of thumb here is that an externally visible side effect is anything
that would affect the execution of the remainder of the program if the function
were not executed.

!!! note
    The `:effect_free` assertion is made both for the method itself and any code
    that is executed by the method. Keep in mind that the assertion must be
    valid for all world ages and limit use of this assertion accordingly.

---
# `:nothrow`

The `:nothrow` settings asserts that this method does not terminate abnormally
(i.e. will either always return a value or never return).

!!! note
    It is permissible for `:nothrow` annotated methods to make use of exception
    handling internally as long as the exception is not rethrown out of the
    method itself.

!!! note
    `MethodErrors` and similar exceptions count as abnormal termination.

---
# `:terminates_globally`

The `:terminates_globally` settings asserts that this method will eventually terminate
(either normally or abnormally), i.e. does not loop indefinitely.

!!! note
    This `:terminates_globally` assertion covers any other methods called by the annotated method.

!!! note
    The compiler will consider this a strong indication that the method will
    terminate relatively *quickly* and may (if otherwise legal), call this
    method at compile time. I.e. it is a bad idea to annotate this setting
    on a method that *technically*, but not *practically*, terminates.

---
# `:terminates_locally`

The `:terminates_locally` setting is like `:terminates_globally`, except that it only
applies to syntactic control flow *within* the annotated method. It is thus
a much weaker (and thus safer) assertion that allows for the possibility of
non-termination if the method calls some other method that does not terminate.

!!! note
    `:terminates_globally` implies `:terminates_locally`.

---
# `:notaskstate`

The `:notaskstate` setting asserts that the method does not use or modify the
local task state (task local storage, RNG state, etc.) and may thus be safely
moved between tasks without observable results.

!!! note
    The implementation of exception handling makes use of state stored in the
    task object. However, this state is currently not considered to be within
    the scope of `:notaskstate` and is tracked separately using the `:nothrow`
    effect.

!!! note
    The `:notaskstate` assertion concerns the state of the *currently running task*.
    If a reference to a `Task` object is obtained by some other means that
    does not consider which task is *currently* running, the `:notaskstate`
    effect need not be tainted. This is true, even if said task object happens
    to be `===` to the currently running task.

!!! note
    Access to task state usually also results in the tainting of other effects,
    such as `:effect_free` (if task state is modified) or `:consistent` (if
    task state is used in the computation of the result). In particular,
    code that is not `:notaskstate`, but is `:effect_free` and `:consistent`
    may still be dead-code-eliminated and thus promoted to `:total`.

---
# `:foldable`

This setting is a convenient shortcut for the set of effects that the compiler
requires to be guaranteed to constant fold a call at compile time. It is
currently equivalent to the following `setting`s:

- `:consistent`
- `:effect_free`
- `:terminates_globally`

!!! note
    This list in particular does not include `:nothrow`. The compiler will still
    attempt constant propagation and note any thrown error at compile time. Note
    however, that by the `:consistent`-cy requirements, any such annotated call
    must consistently throw given the same argument values.

---
# `:total`

This `setting` is the maximum possible set of effects. It currently implies
the following other `setting`s:
- `:consistent`
- `:effect_free`
- `:nothrow`
- `:terminates_globally`
- `:notaskstate`

!!! warning
    `:total` is a very strong assertion and will likely gain additional semantics
    in future versions of julia (e.g. if additional effects are added and included
    in the definition of `:total`). As a result, it should be used with care.
    Whenever possible, prefer to use the minimum possible set of specific effect
    assertions required for a particular application. In cases where a large
    number of effect overrides apply to a set of functions, a custom macro is
    recommended over the use of `:total`.

---

## Negated effects

Effect names may be prefixed by `!` to indicate that the effect should be removed
from an earlier meta effect. For example, `:total !:nothrow` indicates that while
the call is generally total, it may however throw.

## Comparison to `@pure`

`@assume_effects :foldable` is similar to [`@pure`](@ref) with the primary
distinction that the `:consistent`-cy requirement applies world-age wise rather
than globally as described above. However, in particular, a method annotated
`@pure` should always be at least `:foldable`.
Another advantage is that effects introduced by `@assume_effects` are propagated to
callers interprocedurally while a purity defined by `@pure` is not.

    @generated f

`@generated` is used to annotate a function which will be generated.
In the body of the generated function, only types of arguments can be read
(not the values). The function returns a quoted expression evaluated when the
function is called. The `@generated` macro should not be used on functions mutating
the global scope or depending on mutable elements.

See [Metaprogramming](@ref) for further details.

## Example:
```jldoctest
julia> @generated function bar(x)
           if x <: Integer
               return :(x ^ 2)
           else

    @atomic var
    @atomic order ex

Mark `var` or `ex` as being performed atomically, if `ex` is a supported expression.

    @atomic a.b.x = new
    @atomic a.b.x += addend
    @atomic :release a.b.x = new
    @atomic :acquire_release a.b.x += addend

Perform the store operation expressed on the right atomically and return the
new value.

With `=`, this operation translates to a `setproperty!(a.b, :x, new)` call.
With any operator also, this operation translates to a `modifyproperty!(a.b,
:x, +, addend)[2]` call.

    @atomic a.b.x max arg2
    @atomic a.b.x + arg2
    @atomic max(a.b.x, arg2)
    @atomic :acquire_release max(a.b.x, arg2)
    @atomic :acquire_release a.b.x + arg2
    @atomic :acquire_release a.b.x max arg2

Perform the binary operation expressed on the right atomically. Store the
result into the field in the first argument and return the values `(old, new)`.

This operation translates to a `modifyproperty!(a.b, :x, func, arg2)` call.
