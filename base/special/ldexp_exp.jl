    _ldexp_exp(x, l2)
Returns exp(x) * 2^l2. The function is intended for large arguments, x, where
x >= ln(prevfloat(typemax(x)) and care is needed to avoid overflow.

The present implementation is narrowly tailored for our hyperbolic and
exponential functions.  We assume l2 is small (0 or -1), and the caller
has filtered out very large x, for which overflow would be inevitable.
