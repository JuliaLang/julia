    cbrt(x::Real)

Return the cube root of `x`, i.e. ``x^{1/3}``. Negative values are accepted
(returning the negative real root when ``x < 0``).

The prefix operator `∛` is equivalent to `cbrt`.

# Examples
```jldoctest
julia> cbrt(big(27))
3.0

julia> cbrt(big(-27))
-3.0
```

cbrt(x::Real) = cbrt(float(x))
cbrt(x::AbstractFloat) = x < 0 ? -(-x)^(1//3) : x^(1//3)

    _approx_cbrt(x)

Approximate `cbrt` to 5 bits precision

    cbrt(2^e * (1+m)) ≈ 2^(e÷3) * (1 + (e%3+m)÷3)

where:
 - `e` is integral and >= 0
 - `m` is real and in [0, 1),
 - `÷` is integer division
 - `%` is integer remainder

The RHS is always >= the LHS and has a maximum relative error of about 1 in 16.
Adding a bias of -0.03306235651 to the `(e%3+m)÷3` term reduces the error to about 1 in
32.

With the IEEE floating point representation, for finite positive normal values, ordinary
integer divison of the value in bits magically gives almost exactly the RHS of the above
provided we first subtract the exponent bias and later add it back.  We do the
subtraction virtually to keep e >= 0 so that ordinary integer division rounds towards
minus infinity; this is also efficient. All operations can be done in 32-bit.

These implementations assume that NaNs, infinities and zeros have already been filtered.
