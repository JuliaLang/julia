The benefit of this setting is to avoid excessive compilation and reduce invalidation risks
in poorly-inferred cases. For example, when `@max_methods 2` is set and there are two
potentially-matching methods returning different types inside a function body, then Julia
will compile subsequent calls for both types so that the compiled function body accounts
for both possibilities. Also the compiled code is vulnerable to invalidations that would
happen when either of the two methods gets invalidated. This speculative compilation and
these invalidations can be avoided by setting `@max_methods 1` and allowing the compiled
code to resort to runtime dispatch instead.

"""
    Experimental.register_error_hint(handler, exceptiontype)

Register a "hinting" function `handler(io, exception)` that can
suggest potential ways for users to circumvent errors.  `handler`
should examine `exception` to see whether the conditions appropriate
for a hint are met, and if so generate output to `io`.
Packages should call `register_error_hint` from within their
`__init__` function.

For specific exception types, `handler` is required to accept additional arguments:

- `MethodError`: provide `handler(io, exc::MethodError, argtypes, kwargs)`,
  which splits the combined arguments into positional and keyword arguments.

When issuing a hint, the output should typically start with `\\n`.

If you define custom exception types, your `showerror` method can
support hints by calling [`Experimental.show_error_hints`](@ref).

# Examples

```
julia> module Hinter

       only_int(x::Int)      = 1
       any_number(x::Number) = 2

       function __init__()
           Base.Experimental.register_error_hint(MethodError) do io, exc, argtypes, kwargs
               if exc.f == only_int
                    # Color is not necessary, this is just to show it's possible.
                    print(io, "\\nDid you mean to call ")
                    printstyled(io, "`any_number`?", color=:cyan)
               end
           end
       end

       end
```

Then if you call `Hinter.only_int` on something that isn't an `Int` (thereby triggering a `MethodError`), it issues the hint:

```
julia> Hinter.only_int(1.0)
ERROR: MethodError: no method matching only_int(::Float64)
The function `only_int` exists, but no method is defined for this combination of argument types.
Did you mean to call `any_number`?

    Base.Experimental.@overlay mt [function def]

Define a method and add it to the method table `mt` instead of to the global method table.
This can be used to implement a method override mechanism. Regular compilation will not
consider these methods, and you should customize the compilation flow to look in these
method tables (e.g., using [`Core.Compiler.OverlayMethodTable`](@ref)).

!!! note
    Please be aware that when defining overlay methods using `@overlay`, it is not necessary
    to have an original method that corresponds exactly in terms of how the method dispatches.
    This means that the method overlay mechanism enabled by `@overlay` is not implemented by
    replacing the methods themselves, but through an additional and prioritized method
    lookup during the method dispatch.

    Considering this, it is important to understand that in compilations using an overlay
    method table like the following, the method dispatched by `callx(x)` is not the regular
    method `callx(::Float64)`, but the overlay method `callx(x::Real)`:
    ```julia
    callx(::Real) = :real
    @overlay SOME_OVERLAY_MT callx(::Real) = :overlay_real
    callx(::Float64) = :float64

    # some overlay callsite
    let x::Float64
        callx(x) #> :overlay_real
    end
    ```

    inner = Base.unwrap_macrocalls(def)

end

"""
    Base.Experimental.@consistent_overlay mt [function def]

This macro operates almost identically to [`Base.Experimental.@overlay`](@ref), defining a
new overlay method. The key difference with this macro is that it informs the compiler that
the invocation of the overlay method it defines is `:consistent` with a regular,
non-overlayed method call.

More formally, when evaluating a generic function call ``f(x)`` at a specific world age
``i``, if a regular method call ``fᵢ(x)`` is redirected to an overlay method call ``fᵢ′(x)``
defined by this macro, it must be ensured that ``fᵢ(x) ≡ fᵢ′(x)``.

For a detailed definition of `:consistent`-cy, consult the corresponding section in
[`Base.@assume_effects`](@ref).

!!! note
    Note that the requirements for `:consistent`-cy include not only that the return values
    are egal, but also that the manner of termination is the same.
    However, it's important to aware that when they throw exceptions, the exceptions
    themselves don't necessarily have to be egal as explained in the note of `:consistent`.
    In other words, if ``fᵢ(x)`` throws an exception, ``fᵢ′(x)`` is required to also throw
    one, but the exact exceptions may differ.

!!! note
    Please note that the `:consistent`-cy requirement applies not to method itself but to
    _method invocation_. This means that for the use of `@consistent_overlay`, it is
    necessary for method invocations with the native regular compilation and those with
    a compilation with overlay method table to be `:consistent`.

    For example, it is important to understand that, `@consistent_overlay` can be used like
    the following:
    ```julia
    callsin(x::Real) = x < 0 ? error(x) : sin(x)
    @consistent_overlay SOME_OVERLAY_MT callsin(x::Float64) =
        x < 0 ? error_somehow(x) : sin(x)
    ```
    However, be aware that this `@consistent_overlay` will immediately become invalid if a
    new method for `callsin` is defined subsequently, such as:
    ```julia
    callsin(x::Float64) = cos(x)
    ```

    This specifically implies that the use of `@consistent_overlay` should be restricted as
    much as possible to cases where a regular method with a concrete signature is replaced
    by an overlay method with the same concrete signature.

    This constraint is closely related to the note in [`Base.Experimental.@overlay`](@ref);
    you are advised to consult that as well.
