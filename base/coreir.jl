    end

This extended lattice element is introduced when we have information about an object's
fields beyond what can be obtained from the object type. E.g. it represents a tuple where
some elements are known to be constants or a struct whose `Any`-typed field is initialized
with `Int` values.

- `typ` indicates the type of the object
- `fields` holds the lattice elements corresponding to each field of the object

If `typ` is a struct, `fields` represents the fields of the struct that are guaranteed to be
initialized. For instance, if the length of `fields` of `PartialStruct` representing a
struct with 4 fields is 3, the 4th field may not be initialized. If the length is 4, all
fields are guaranteed to be initialized.

If `typ` is a tuple, the last element of `fields` may be `Vararg`. In this case, it is
guaranteed that the number of elements in the tuple is at least `length(fields)-1`, but the
exact number of elements is unknown.

Similar to `Conditional`, but conveys inter-procedural constraints imposed on call arguments.
This is separate from `Conditional` to catch logic errors: the lattice element name is `InterConditional`
while processing a call, then `Conditional` everywhere else.
