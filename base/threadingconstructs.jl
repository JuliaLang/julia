"""
    Threads.@threads [schedule] for ... end

A macro to execute a `for` loop in parallel. The iteration space is distributed to
coarse-grained tasks. This policy can be specified by the `schedule` argument. The
execution of the loop waits for the evaluation of all iterations.

See also: [`@spawn`](@ref Threads.@spawn) and
`pmap` in [`Distributed`](@ref man-distributed).

# Extended help

## Semantics

Unless stronger guarantees are specified by the scheduling option, the loop executed by
`@threads` macro have the following semantics.

The `@threads` macro executes the loop body in an unspecified order and potentially
concurrently. It does not specify the exact assignments of the tasks and the worker threads.
The assignments can be different for each execution. The loop body code (including any code
transitively called from it) must not make any assumptions about the distribution of
iterations to tasks or the worker thread in which they are executed. The loop body for each
iteration must be able to make forward progress independent of other iterations and be free
from data races. As such, invalid synchronizations across iterations may deadlock while
unsynchronized memory accesses may result in undefined behavior.

For example, the above conditions imply that:

- A lock taken in an iteration *must* be released within the same iteration.
- Communicating between iterations using blocking primitives like `Channel`s is incorrect.
- Write only to locations not shared across iterations (unless a lock or atomic operation is
  used).
- The value of [`threadid()`](@ref Threads.threadid) may change even within a single
  iteration.

## Schedulers

Without the scheduler argument, the exact scheduling is unspecified and varies across Julia
releases. Currently, `:dynamic` is used when the scheduler is not specified.

!!! compat "Julia 1.5"
    The `schedule` argument is available as of Julia 1.5.

### `:dynamic` (default)

`:dynamic` scheduler executes iterations dynamically to available worker threads. Current
implementation assumes that the workload for each iteration is uniform. However, this
assumption may be removed in the future.

This scheduling option is merely a hint to the underlying execution mechanism. However, a
few properties can be expected. The number of `Task`s used by `:dynamic` scheduler is
bounded by a small constant multiple of the number of available worker threads
([`Threads.threadpoolsize()`](@ref)). Each task processes contiguous regions of the
iteration space. Thus, `@threads :dynamic for x in xs; f(x); end` is typically more
efficient than `@sync for x in xs; @spawn f(x); end` if `length(xs)` is significantly
larger than the number of the worker threads and the run-time of `f(x)` is relatively
smaller than the cost of spawning and synchronizing a task (typically less than 10
microseconds).

!!! compat "Julia 1.8"
    The `:dynamic` option for the `schedule` argument is available and the default as of Julia 1.8.

### `:static`

`:static` scheduler creates one task per thread and divides the iterations equally among
them, assigning each task specifically to each thread. In particular, the value of
[`threadid()`](@ref Threads.threadid) is guaranteed to be constant within one iteration.
Specifying `:static` is an error if used from inside another `@threads` loop or from a
thread other than 1.

!!! note
    `:static` scheduling exists for supporting transition of code written before Julia 1.3.
    In newly written library functions, `:static` scheduling is discouraged because the
    functions using this option cannot be called from arbitrary worker threads.

## Example

To illustrate of the different scheduling strategies, consider the following function
`busywait` containing a non-yielding timed loop that runs for a given number of seconds.

```julia-repl
julia> function busywait(seconds)
            tstart = time_ns()
            while (time_ns() - tstart) / 1e9 < seconds
            end
        end

julia> @time begin
            Threads.@spawn busywait(5)
            Threads.@threads :static for i in 1:Threads.threadpoolsize()
                busywait(1)
            end
        end
6.003001 seconds (16.33 k allocations: 899.255 KiB, 0.25% compilation time)

julia> @time begin
            Threads.@spawn busywait(5)
            Threads.@threads :dynamic for i in 1:Threads.threadpoolsize()
                busywait(1)
            end
        end
2.012056 seconds (16.05 k allocations: 883.919 KiB, 0.66% compilation time)
```

The `:dynamic` example takes 2 seconds since one of the non-occupied threads is able
to run two of the 1-second iterations to complete the for loop.

"""
    Threads.@spawn [:default|:interactive] expr

Create a [`Task`](@ref) and [`schedule`](@ref) it to run on any available
thread in the specified threadpool (`:default` if unspecified). The task is
allocated to a thread once one becomes available. To wait for the task to
finish, call [`wait`](@ref) on the result of this macro, or call
[`fetch`](@ref) to wait and then obtain its return value.

Values can be interpolated into `@spawn` via `\$`, which copies the value
directly into the constructed underlying closure. This allows you to insert
the _value_ of a variable, isolating the asynchronous code from changes to
the variable's value in the current task.
