A macro to parallelize a for-loop to run with multiple threads. This spawns [`nthreads()`](@ref)
number of threads, splits the iteration space amongst them, and iterates in parallel.
A barrier is placed at the end of the loop which waits for all the threads to finish
execution, and the loop returns.

    Threads.@spawn expr

Create and run a [`Task`](@ref) on any available thread. To wait for the task to
finish, call [`wait`](@ref) on the result of this macro, or call [`fetch`](@ref)
to wait and then obtain its return value.

Values can be interpolated into `@spawn` via `\$`, which copies the value directly into the
constructed underlying closure. This allows you to insert the _value_ of a variable,
isolating the aysnchronous code from changes to the variable's value in the current task.

!!! note
    This feature is currently considered experimental.

!!! compat "Julia 1.3"
    This macro is available as of Julia 1.3.

!!! compat "Julia 1.4"
    Interpolating values via `\$` is available as of Julia 1.4.
