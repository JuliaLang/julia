    Threads.@threads

A macro to parallelize a for-loop to run with multiple threads. This spawns `nthreads()`
number of threads, splits the iteration space amongst them, and iterates in parallel.
A barrier is placed at the end of the loop which waits for all the threads to finish
execution, and the loop returns.
