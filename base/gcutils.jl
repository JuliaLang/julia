    finalizer(f, x)

Register a function `f(x)` to be called when there are no program-accessible references to
`x`, and return `x`. The type of `x` must be a `mutable struct`, otherwise the behavior of
this function is unpredictable.

`f` must not cause a task switch, which excludes most I/O operations such as `println`.
Using the `@async` macro (to defer context switching to outside of the finalizer) or
`ccall` to directly invoke IO functions in C may be helpful for debugging purposes.

# Examples
```julia
finalizer(my_mutable_struct) do x
    @async println("Finalizing \$x.")
end

finalizer(my_mutable_struct) do x
    ccall(:jl_safe_printf, Cvoid, (Cstring, Cstring), "Finalizing %s.", repr(x))
end
```

A finalizer may be registered at object construction. In the following example note that
we implicitly rely on the finalizer returning the newly created mutable struct `x`.

# Example
```julia
mutable struct MyMutableStruct
    bar
    function MyMutableStruct(bar)
        x = new(bar)
        f(t) = @async println("Finalizing \$t.")
        finalizer(f, x)
    end
end
```

Perform garbage collection. The argument `full` determines the kind of

so-called young objects.

    use to grow without bound.

"""
    GC.@preserve x1 x2 ... xn expr

Mark the objects `x1, x2, ...` as being *in use* during the evaluation of the
expression `expr`. This is only required in unsafe code where `expr`
*implicitly uses* memory or other resources owned by one of the `x`s.

*Implicit use* of `x` covers any indirect use of resources logically owned by
`x` which the compiler cannot see. Some examples:
* Accessing memory of an object directly via a `Ptr`
* Passing a pointer to `x` to `ccall`
* Using resources of `x` which would be cleaned up in the finalizer.

`@preserve` should generally not have any performance impact in typical use
cases where it briefly extends object lifetime. In implementation, `@preserve`
has effects such as protecting dynamically allocated objects from garbage
collection.

# Examples

When loading from a pointer with `unsafe_load`, the underlying object is
implicitly used, for example `x` is implicitly used by `unsafe_load(p)` in the
following:

```jldoctest
julia> let
           x = Ref{Int}(101)
           p = Base.unsafe_convert(Ptr{Int}, x)
           GC.@preserve x unsafe_load(p)
       end
101
```

When passing pointers to `ccall`, the pointed-to object is implicitly used and
should be preserved. (Note however that you should normally just pass `x`
directly to `ccall` which counts as an explicit use.)

```jldoctest
julia> let
           x = "Hello"
           p = pointer(x)
           Int(GC.@preserve x @ccall strlen(p::Cstring)::Csize_t)
           # Preferred alternative
           Int(@ccall strlen(x::Cstring)::Csize_t)
       end
5
```

macro preserve(args...)
    syms = args[1:end-1]
    for x in syms

"""
    GC.safepoint()

Inserts a point in the program where garbage collection may run.
This can be useful in rare cases in multi-threaded programs where some threads
are allocating memory (and hence may need to run GC) but other threads are doing
only simple operations (no allocation, task switches, or I/O).
Calling this function periodically in non-allocating threads allows garbage
collection to run.
