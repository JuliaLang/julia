# trait for objects that support ranges with regular step
"""
    RangeStepStyle(instance)
    RangeStepStyle(T::Type)

Indicate whether an instance or a type supports constructing a range with
a perfectly regular step or not. A regular step means that
[`step`](@ref) will always be exactly equal to the difference between two
subsequent elements in a range, i.e. for a range `r::AbstractRange{T}`:
```julia
all(diff(r) .== step(r))
```

When a type `T` always leads to ranges with regular steps, it should
define the following method:
```julia
Base.RangeStepStyle(::Type{<:AbstractRange{<:T}}) = Base.RangeStepRegular()
```
This will allow [`hash`](@ref) to use an O(1) algorithm for `AbstractRange{T}`
objects instead of the default O(N) algorithm (with N the length of the range).

In some cases, whether the step will be regular depends not only on the
element type `T`, but also on the type of the step `S`. In that case, more
specific methods should be defined:
```julia
Base.RangeStepStyle(::Type{<:OrdinalRange{<:T, <:S}}) = Base.RangeStepRegular()
```

By default, all range types are assumed to be `RangeStepIrregular`, except
ranges with an element type which is a subtype of `Integer`.

struct RangeStepIrregular <: RangeStepStyle end # range with rounding error
