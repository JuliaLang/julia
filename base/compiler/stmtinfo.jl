    struct MethodMatchInfo

Captures the result of a `method_matches` lookup for the given call. This
info may then be used by the optimizer to inline the matches, without having
to re-consult the method table. This info is illegal on any statement that is
not a call to a generic function.

    struct UnionSplitInfo

If inference decides to partition the method search space by splitting unions,
it will issue a method lookup query for each such partition. This info indicates
