    struct MethodMatchInfo

Captures the result of a `method_matches` lookup for the given call. This
info may then be used by the optimizer to inline the matches, without having
to re-consult the method table. This info is illegal on any statement that is
not a call to a generic function.

    results::Union{Missing, MethodLookupResult}

"""
    struct MethodResultPure

This singleton represents a method result constant was proven to be
effect-free, including being no-throw (typically because the value was computed
by calling an `@pure` function).
"""
struct MethodResultPure end

"""
    struct UnionSplitInfo

If inference decides to partition the method search space by splitting unions,
it will issue a method lookup query for each such partition. This info indicates
that such partitioning happened and wraps the corresponding MethodMatchInfo for
each partition. This info is illegal on any statement that is not a call to a
generic function.

"""
    struct CallMeta

A simple struct that captures both the return type (`rt`) and any additional information
(`info`) for a given generic call.

struct CallMeta
    rt::Any
    info::Any

"""
    struct AbstractIterationInfo

Captures all the information for abstract iteration analysis of a single value.
Each (abstract) call to `iterate`, corresponds to one entry in `each`.

"""
    struct ApplyCallInfo

This info applies to any call of `_apply_iterate(...)` and captures both the
info of the actual call being applied and the info for any implicit call
to the `iterate` function. Note that it is possible for the call itself
to be yet another `_apply_iterate`, in which case the `.call` field will
be another `ApplyCallInfo`. This info is illegal on any statement that is
not an `_apply_iterate` call.

Like `UnionSplitInfo`, but for `ApplyCallInfo` rather than MethodMatchInfo.
This info is illegal on any statement that is not an `_apply_iterate` call.
