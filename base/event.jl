## condition variables

"""
    Condition()

Create an edge-triggered event source that tasks can wait for. Tasks that call [`wait`](@ref) on a
`Condition` are suspended and queued. Tasks are woken up when [`notify`](@ref) is later called on
the `Condition`. Edge triggering means that only tasks waiting at the time [`notify`](@ref) is
called can be woken up. For level-triggered notifications, you must keep extra state to keep
track of whether a notification has happened. The [`Channel`](@ref) type does
this, and so can be used for level-triggered events.
"""
mutable struct Condition
    waitq::Vector{Any}

    Condition() = new([])
end

"""
    wait([x])

Block the current task until some event occurs, depending on the type of the argument:

* [`RemoteChannel`](@ref) : Wait for a value to become available on the specified remote
  channel.
* [`Future`](@ref) : Wait for a value to become available for the specified future.
* [`Channel`](@ref): Wait for a value to be appended to the channel.
* [`Condition`](@ref): Wait for [`notify`](@ref) on a condition.
* `Process`: Wait for a process or process chain to exit. The `exitcode` field of a process
  can be used to determine success or failure.
* [`Task`](@ref): Wait for a `Task` to finish, returning its result value. If the task fails
  with an exception, the exception is propagated (re-thrown in the task that called `wait`).
* `RawFD`: Wait for changes on a file descriptor (see [`poll_fd`](@ref) for keyword
  arguments and return code)

If no argument is passed, the task blocks for an undefined period. A task can only be
restarted by an explicit call to [`schedule`](@ref) or [`yieldto`](@ref).

Often `wait` is called within a `while` loop to ensure a waited-for condition is met before
proceeding.

Wake up tasks waiting for a condition, passing them `val`. If `all` is `true` (the default),
all waiting tasks are woken, otherwise only one is. If `error` is `true`, the passed value
is raised as an exception in the woken tasks.

Returns the count of tasks woken up. Returns 0 if no tasks are waiting on `condition`.

Add a [`Task`](@ref) to the scheduler's queue. This causes the task to run constantly when the system

If a second argument `val` is provided, it will be passed to the task (via the return value of
[`yieldto`](@ref)) when it runs again. If `error` is `true`, the value is raised as an exception in
the woken task.
