    AlwaysLockedST

This struct does not implement a real lock, but instead
pretends to be always locked on the original thread it was allocated on,
and simply ignores all other interactions.
It also does not synchronize tasks; for that use a real lock such as [`RecursiveLock`](@ref).
This can be used in the place of a real lock to, instead, simply and cheaply assert
that the operation is only occurring on a single cooperatively-scheduled thread.
It is thus functionally equivalent to allocating a real, recursive, task-unaware lock
immediately calling `lock` on it, and then never calling a matching `unlock`,
except that calling `lock` from another thread will throw a concurrency violation exception.

    wait([x])

Block the current task until some event occurs, depending on the type of the argument:

* [`Channel`](@ref): Wait for a value to be appended to the channel.
* [`Condition`](@ref): Wait for [`notify`](@ref) on a condition.
* `Process`: Wait for a process or process chain to exit. The `exitcode` field of a process
  can be used to determine success or failure.
* [`Task`](@ref): Wait for a `Task` to finish. If the task fails with an exception, the
  exception is propagated (re-thrown in the task that called `wait`).
* [`RawFD`](@ref): Wait for changes on a file descriptor (see the `FileWatching` package).

If no argument is passed, the task blocks for an undefined period. A task can only be
restarted by an explicit call to [`schedule`](@ref) or [`yieldto`](@ref).

Often `wait` is called within a `while` loop to ensure a waited-for condition is met before
proceeding.

is raised as an exception in the woken tasks.

"""
    Condition()

Create an edge-triggered event source that tasks can wait for. Tasks that call [`wait`](@ref) on a
`Condition` are suspended and queued. Tasks are woken up when [`notify`](@ref) is later called on
the `Condition`. Edge triggering means that only tasks waiting at the time [`notify`](@ref) is
called can be woken up. For level-triggered notifications, you must keep extra state to keep
track of whether a notification has happened. The [`Channel`](@ref) and [`Threads.Event`](@ref) types do
this, and can be used for level-triggered events.

This object is NOT thread-safe. See [`Threads.Condition`](@ref) for a thread-safe version.
