## generic comparison ##

"""
    ==(x, y)

Generic equality operator. Falls back to [`===`](@ref).
Should be implemented for all types with a notion of equality, based on the abstract value
that an instance represents. For example, all numeric types are compared by numeric value,
ignoring type. Strings are compared as sequences of characters, ignoring encoding.
For collections, `==` is generally called recursively on all contents,
though other properties (like the shape for arrays) may also be taken into account.

This operator follows IEEE semantics for floating-point numbers: `0.0 == -0.0` and
`NaN != NaN`.

The result is of type `Bool`, except when one of the operands is [`missing`](@ref),
in which case `missing` is returned
([three-valued logic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three-valued_logic)).
For collections, `missing` is returned if at least one of the operands contains
a `missing` value and all non-missing values are equal.
Use [`isequal`](@ref) or [`===`](@ref) to always get a `Bool` result.

# Implementation
New numeric types should implement this function for two arguments of the new type, and
handle comparison to other types via promotion rules where possible.

[`isequal`](@ref) falls back to `==`, so new methods of `==` will be used by the
[`Dict`](@ref) type to compare keys. If your type will be used as a dictionary key, it
should therefore also implement [`hash`](@ref).
"""
==(x, y) = x === y

"""
    isequal(x, y)

Similar to [`==`](@ref), except for the treatment of floating point numbers
and of missing values. `isequal` treats all floating-point `NaN` values as equal
to each other, treats `-0.0` as unequal to `0.0`, and [`missing`](@ref) as equal
to `missing`. Always returns a `Bool` value.

# Implementation
The default implementation of `isequal` calls `==`, so a type that does not involve
floating-point values generally only needs to define `==`.

`isequal` is the comparison function used by hash tables (`Dict`). `isequal(x,y)` must imply
that `hash(x) == hash(y)`.

This typically means that types for which a custom `==` or `isequal` method exists must
implement a corresponding `hash` method (and vice versa). Collections typically implement
`isequal` by calling `isequal` recursively on all contents.

Scalar types generally do not need to implement `isequal` separate from `==`, unless they
represent floating-point numbers amenable to a more efficient implementation than that
provided as a generic fallback (based on `isnan`, `signbit`, and `==`).

# Examples
```jldoctest
julia> isequal([1., NaN], [1., NaN])
true

julia> [1., NaN] == [1., NaN]
false

julia> 0.0 == -0.0
true

julia> isequal(0.0, -0.0)
false
```

isequal(x::AbstractFloat, y::Real         ) = (isnan(x) & isnan(y)) | signequal(x, y) & (x == y)

"""
    isless(x, y)

Test whether `x` is less than `y`, according to a fixed total order.
`isless` is not defined on all pairs of values `(x, y)`. However, if it
is defined, it is expected to satisfy the following:
- If `isless(x, y)` is defined, then so is `isless(y, x)` and `isequal(x, y)`,
  and exactly one of those three yields `true`.
- The relation defined by `isless` is transitive, i.e.,
  `isless(x, y) && isless(y, z)` implies `isless(x, z)`.

Values that are normally unordered, such as `NaN`,
are ordered in an arbitrary but consistent fashion.
[`missing`](@ref) values are ordered last.

This is the default comparison used by [`sort`](@ref).

# Implementation
Non-numeric types with a total order should implement this function.
Numeric types only need to implement it if they have special values such as `NaN`.
Types with a partial order should implement [`<`](@ref).

i.e. given a function returns a new function that takes one argument and splats
its argument into the original function. This is useful as an adaptor to pass
a multi-argument function in a context that expects a single argument, but
passes a tuple as that single argument.

    in(item, collection) -> Bool
    ∈(item, collection) -> Bool
    ∋(collection, item) -> Bool

Determine whether an item is in the given collection, in the sense that it is
[`==`](@ref) to one of the values generated by iterating over the collection.
Returns a `Bool` value, except if `item` is [`missing`](@ref) or `collection`
contains `missing` but not `item`, in which case `missing` is returned
([three-valued logic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three-valued_logic),
matching the behavior of [`any`](@ref) and [`==`](@ref)).

Some collections follow a slightly different definition. For example,
[`Set`](@ref)s check whether the item [`isequal`](@ref) to one of the elements.
[`Dict`](@ref)s look for `key=>value` pairs, and the key is compared using
[`isequal`](@ref). To test for the presence of a key in a dictionary,
use [`haskey`](@ref) or `k in keys(dict)`. For these collections, the result
is always a `Bool` and never `missing`.

```jldoctest
julia> a = 1:3:20
1:3:19

julia> 4 in a
true

julia> 5 in a
false

julia> missing in [1, 2]
