    ReentrantLock()

Creates a re-entrant lock for synchronizing [`Task`](@ref)s. The same task can
acquire the lock as many times as required. Each [`lock`](@ref) must be matched
with an [`unlock`](@ref).

Calling 'lock' will also inhibit running of finalizers on that thread until the
corresponding 'unlock'. Use of the standard lock pattern illustrated below
should naturally be supported, but beware of inverting the try/lock order or
missing the try block entirely (e.g. attempting to return with the lock still
held):

```
lock(l)
try
    <atomic work>
finally
    unlock(l)
end
```
