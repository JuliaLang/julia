"""
    pgenerate([::WorkerPool], f, c...) -> iterator

Apply `f` to each element of `c` in parallel using available workers and tasks.

For multiple collection arguments, apply f elementwise.

Results are returned in order as they become available.

Note that `f` must be made available to all worker processes; see
[Code Availability and Loading Packages](:ref:`Code Availability
and Loading Packages <man-parallel-computing-code-availability>`)
for details.
