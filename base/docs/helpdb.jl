    dlopen(libfile::AbstractString [, flags::Integer])

Load a shared library, returning an opaque handle.

The optional flags argument is a bitwise-or of zero or more of `RTLD_LOCAL`, `RTLD_GLOBAL`, `RTLD_LAZY`, `RTLD_NOW`, `RTLD_NODELETE`, `RTLD_NOLOAD`, `RTLD_DEEPBIND`, and `RTLD_FIRST`. These are converted to the corresponding flags of the POSIX (and/or GNU libc and/or MacOS) dlopen command, if possible, or are ignored if the specified functionality is not available on the current platform. The default flags are platform specific. On MacOS the default `dlopen` flags are `RTLD_LAZY|RTLD_DEEPBIND|RTLD_GLOBAL` while on other platforms the defaults are `RTLD_LAZY|RTLD_DEEPBIND|RTLD_LOCAL`. An important usage of these flags is to specify non default behavior for when the dynamic library loader binds library references to exported symbols and if the bound references are put into process local or global scope. For instance `RTLD_LAZY|RTLD_DEEPBIND|RTLD_GLOBAL` allows the library's symbols to be available for usage in other shared libraries, addressing situations where there are dependencies between shared libraries.

If `pivot==Val{false}` a `PosDefException` exception is thrown in case the matrix is not positive definite. The argument `tol` determines the tolerance for determining the rank. For negative values, the tolerance is the machine precision.
"""
cholfact(A, LU=:U, pivot=Val{false})

doc"""
    cholfact(A; shift=0, perm=Int[]) -> CHOLMOD.Factor

Compute the Cholesky factorization of a sparse positive definite matrix `A`. A fill-reducing permutation is used. `F = cholfact(A)` is most frequently used to solve systems of equations with `F\b`, but also the methods `diag`, `det`, `logdet` are defined for `F`. You can also extract individual factors from `F`, using `F[:L]`. However, since pivoting is on by default, the factorization is internally represented as `A == P'*L*L'*P` with a permutation matrix `P`; using just `L` without accounting for `P` will give incorrect answers. To include the effects of permutation, it's typically preferable to extact "combined" factors like `PtL = F[:PtL]` (the equivalent of `P'*L`) and `LtP = F[:UP]` (the equivalent of `L'*P`).

Setting optional `shift` keyword argument computes the factorization of `A+shift*I` instead of `A`. If the `perm` argument is nonempty, it should be a permutation of `1:size(A,1)` giving the ordering to use (instead of CHOLMOD's default AMD ordering).

    utf32(s)

Create a UTF-32 string from a byte array, array of `Char` or `UInt32`, or any other string type. (Conversions of byte arrays check for a byte-order marker in the first four bytes, and do not include it in the resulting string.)

Note that the resulting `UTF32String` data is terminated by the NUL codepoint (32-bit zero), which is not treated as a character in the string (so that it is mostly invisible in Julia); this allows the string to be passed directly to external functions requiring NUL-terminated data. This NUL is appended automatically by the `utf32(s)` conversion function. If you have a `Char` or `UInt32` array `A` that is already NUL-terminated UTF-32 data, then you can instead use `UTF32String(A)` to construct the string without making a copy of the data and treating the NUL as a terminator rather than as part of the string.

..  Mmap.mmap(io::Union{IOStream,AbstractString,Mmap.AnonymousMmap}[, type::Type{Array{T,N}}, dims, offset]; grow::Bool=true, shared::Bool=true)
           Mmap.mmap(type::Type{Array{T,N}}, dims)

Create an ``Array`` whose values are linked to a file, using memory-mapping. This provides a convenient way of working with data too large to fit in the computer's memory.

The type is an ``Array{T,N}`` with a bits-type element of ``T`` and dimension ``N`` that determines how the bytes of the array are interpreted. Note that the file must be stored in binary format, and no format conversions are possible (this is a limitation of operating systems, not Julia).

``dims`` is a tuple or single ``Integer`` specifying the size or length of the array.

The file is passed via the stream argument, either as an open ``IOStream`` or filename string.  When you initialize the stream, use ``"r"`` for a "read-only" array, and ``"w+"`` to create a new array used to write values to disk.

If no ``type`` argument is specified, the default is ``Vector{UInt8}``.

Optionally, you can specify an offset (in bytes) if, for example, you want to skip over a header in the file. The default value for the offset is the current stream position for an ``IOStream``.

The ``grow`` keyword argument specifies whether the disk file should be grown to accomodate the requested size of array (if the total file size is < requested array size). Write privileges are required to grow the file.

The ``shared`` keyword argument specifies whether the resulting ``Array`` and changes made to it will be visible to other processes mapping the same file.

For example, the following code::

   # Create a file for mmapping
   # (you could alternatively use mmap to do this step, too)
   A = rand(1:20, 5, 30)
   s = open("/tmp/mmap.bin", "w+")
   # We'll write the dimensions of the array as the first two Ints in the file
   write(s, size(A,1))
   write(s, size(A,2))
   # Now write the data
   write(s, A)
   close(s)

   # Test by reading it back in
   s = open("/tmp/mmap.bin")   # default is read-only
   m = read(s, Int)
   n = read(s, Int)
   A2 = Mmap.mmap(s, Matrix{Int}, (m,n))

creates a ``m``-by-``n`` ``Matrix{Int}``, linked to the file associated with stream ``s``.

A more portable file would need to encode the word size---32 bit or 64 bit---and endianness information in the header. In practice, consider encoding binary data using standard formats like HDF5 (which can be used with memory-mapping).

Compute the `LDLt` factorization of a sparse symmetric or Hermitian matrix. A fill-reducing permutation is used. `F = ldltfact(A)` is most frequently used to solve systems of equations `A*x = b` with `F\b`, but also the methods `diag`, `det`, `logdet` are defined for `F`. You can also extract individual factors from `F`, using `F[:L]`. However, since pivoting is on by default, the factorization is internally represented as `A == P'*L*D*L'*P` with a permutation matrix `P`; using just `L` without accounting for `P` will give incorrect answers. To include the effects of permutation, it's typically preferable to extact "combined" factors like `PtL = F[:PtL]` (the equivalent of `P'*L`) and `LtP = F[:UP]` (the equivalent of `L'*P`). The complete list of supported factors is `:L, :PtL, :D, :UP, :U, :LD, :DU, :PtLD, :DUP`.

Setting optional `shift` keyword argument computes the factorization of `A+shift*I` instead of `A`. If the `perm` argument is nonempty, it should be a permutation of `1:size(A,1)` giving the ordering to use (instead of CHOLMOD's default AMD ordering).

The associativity of the reduction is implementation dependent. This means that you can't use non-associative operations like `-` because it is undefined whether `reduce(-,[1,2,3])` should be evaluated as `(1-2)-3` or `1-(2-3)`. Use `foldl` or `foldr` instead for guaranteed left or right associativity.

    eachindex(A...)

Creates an iterable object for visiting each index of an AbstractArray `A` in an efficient manner. For array types that have opted into fast linear indexing (like `Array`), this is simply the range `1:length(A)`. For other array types, this returns a specialized Cartesian range to efficiently index into the array with indices specified for every dimension. For other iterables, including strings and dictionaries, this returns an iterator object supporting arbitrary index types (e.g. unevenly spaced or non-integer indices).

Example for a sparse 2-d array:

    julia> A = sprand(2, 3, 0.5)
    2x3 sparse matrix with 4 Float64 entries:
        [1, 1]  =  0.598888
        [1, 2]  =  0.0230247
        [1, 3]  =  0.486499
        [2, 3]  =  0.809041

    julia> for iter in eachindex(A)
               @show iter.I_1, iter.I_2
               @show A[iter]
           end
    (iter.I_1,iter.I_2) = (1,1)
    A[iter] = 0.5988881393454597
    (iter.I_1,iter.I_2) = (2,1)
    A[iter] = 0.0
    (iter.I_1,iter.I_2) = (1,2)
    A[iter] = 0.02302469881746183
    (iter.I_1,iter.I_2) = (2,2)
    A[iter] = 0.0
    (iter.I_1,iter.I_2) = (1,3)
    A[iter] = 0.4864987874354343
    (iter.I_1,iter.I_2) = (2,3)
    A[iter] = 0.8090413606455655

If you supply more than one ``AbstractArray`` argument, ``eachindex``
will create an iterable object that is fast for all arguments (a
``UnitRange`` if all inputs have fast linear indexing, a
CartesianRange otherwise).  If the arrays have different sizes and/or
dimensionalities, ``eachindex`` returns an iterable that spans the
largest range along each dimension.

Add processes on remote machines via SSH.
Requires julia to be installed in the same location on each node, or to be available via a shared file system.

``machines`` is a vector of machine specifications.  Worker are started for each specification.

A machine specification is either a string ``machine_spec`` or a tuple - ``(machine_spec, count)``

``machine_spec`` is a string of the form ``[user@]host[:port] [bind_addr[:port]]``. ``user`` defaults
to current user, ``port`` to the standard ssh port. If ``[bind_addr[:port]]`` is specified, other
workers will connect to this worker at the specified ``bind_addr`` and ``port``.

``count`` is the number of workers to be launched on the specified host. If specified as ``:auto``
it will launch as many workers as the number of cores on the specific host.


Keyword arguments:

``tunnel`` : if ``true`` then SSH tunneling will be used to connect to the worker from the master process.

``sshflags`` : specifies additional ssh options, e.g. :literal:`sshflags=\`-i /home/foo/bar.pem\`` .

``max_parallel`` : specifies the maximum number of workers connected to in parallel at a host. Defaults to 10.

``dir`` :  specifies the working directory on the workers. Defaults to the host's current directory (as found by ``pwd()``)

``exename`` :  name of the julia executable. Defaults to "$JULIA_HOME/julia" or "$JULIA_HOME/julia-debug" as the case may be.

``exeflags`` :  additional flags passed to the worker processes.

Environment variables :

If the master process fails to establish a connection with a newly launched worker within 60.0 seconds,
the worker treats it a fatal situation and terminates. This timeout can be controlled via environment
variable ``JULIA_WORKER_TIMEOUT``. The value of ``JULIA_WORKER_TIMEOUT`` on the master process, specifies
the number of seconds a newly launched worker waits for connection establishment.

Read a matrix from the source where each line (separated by `eol`) gives one row, with elements separated by the given delimeter. The source can be a text file, stream or byte array. Memory mapped files can be used by passing the byte array representation of the mapped segment as source.

If `T` is a numeric type, the result is an array of that type, with any non-numeric elements as `NaN` for floating-point types, or zero. Other useful values of `T` include `ASCIIString`, `AbstractString`, and `Any`.

If `header` is `true`, the first row of data will be read as header and the tuple `(data_cells, header_cells)` is returned instead of only `data_cells`.

Specifying `skipstart` will ignore the corresponding number of initial lines from the input.

If `skipblanks` is `true`, blank lines in the input will be ignored.

If `use_mmap` is `true`, the file specified by `source` is memory mapped for potential speedups. Default is `true` except on Windows. On Windows, you may want to specify `true` if the file is large, and is only read once and not written to.

If `ignore_invalid_chars` is `true`, bytes in `source` with invalid character encoding will be ignored. Otherwise an error is thrown indicating the offending character position.

If `quotes` is `true`, column enclosed within double-quote (") characters are allowed to contain new lines and column delimiters. Double-quote characters within a quoted field must be escaped with another double-quote.  Specifying `dims` as a tuple of the expected rows and columns (including header, if any) may speed up reading of large files.  If `comments` is `true`, lines beginning with `comment_char` and text following `comment_char` in any line are ignored.

Create a UTF-16 string from a byte array, array of `UInt16`, or any other string type. (Data must be valid UTF-16. Conversions of byte arrays check for a byte-order marker in the first two bytes, and do not include it in the resulting string.)

Note that the resulting `UTF16String` data is terminated by the NUL codepoint (16-bit zero), which is not treated as a character in the string (so that it is mostly invisible in Julia); this allows the string to be passed directly to external functions requiring NUL-terminated data. This NUL is appended automatically by the `utf16(s)` conversion function. If you have a `UInt16` array `A` that is already NUL-terminated valid UTF-16 data, then you can instead use `UTF16String(A)` to construct the string without making a copy of the data and treating the NUL as a terminator rather than as part of the string.

    normalize_string(s, normalform::Symbol)

Normalize the string `s` according to one of the four "normal
forms" of the Unicode standard: `normalform` can be `:NFC`,
`:NFD`, `:NFKC`, or `:NFKD`.  Normal forms C (canonical
composition) and D (canonical decomposition) convert different
visually identical representations of the same abstract string into
a single canonical form, with form C being more compact.  Normal
forms KC and KD additionally canonicalize "compatibility
equivalents": they convert characters that are abstractly similar
but visually distinct into a single canonical choice (e.g. they expand
ligatures into the individual characters), with form KC being more compact.

Alternatively, finer control and additional transformations may be
be obtained by calling `normalize_string(s; keywords...)`, where
any number of the following boolean keywords options (which all default
to `false` except for `compose`) are specified:

* `compose=false`: do not perform canonical composition
* `decompose=true`: do canonical decomposition instead of canonical composition (`compose=true` is ignored if present)
* `compat=true`: compatibility equivalents are canonicalized
* `casefold=true`: perform Unicode case folding, e.g. for case-insensitive string comparison
* `newline2lf=true`, `newline2ls=true`, or `newline2ps=true`: convert various newline sequences (LF, CRLF, CR, NEL) into a linefeed (LF), line-separation (LS), or paragraph-separation (PS) character, respectively
* `stripmark=true`: strip diacritical marks (e.g. accents)
* `stripignore=true`: strip Unicode's "default ignorable" characters (e.g. the soft hyphen or the left-to-right marker)
* `stripcc=true`: strip control characters; horizontal tabs and form feeds are converted to spaces; newlines are also converted to spaces unless a newline-conversion flag was specified
* `rejectna=true`: throw an error if unassigned code points are found
* `stable=true`: enforce Unicode Versioning Stability

For example, NFKC corresponds to the options `compose=true, compat=true, stable=true`.

..  pinv(M[, tol])

Computes the Moore-Penrose pseudoinverse.

For matrices ``M`` with floating point elements, it is convenient to compute
the pseudoinverse by inverting only singular values above a given threshold,
``tol``.

The optimal choice of ``tol`` varies both with the value of ``M``
and the intended application of the pseudoinverse. The default value of
``tol`` is ``eps(real(float(one(eltype(M)))))*maximum(size(A))``,
which is essentially machine epsilon for the real part of a matrix element
multiplied by the larger matrix dimension.
For inverting dense ill-conditioned matrices in a least-squares sense,
``tol = sqrt(eps(real(float(one(eltype(M))))))`` is recommended.

    similar(array, [element_type=eltype(array)], [dims=size(array)])

Create an uninitialized mutable array with the given element type and size,
based upon the given source array. The second and third arguments are both
optional, defaulting to the given array's `eltype` and `size`. The dimensions
may be specified either as a single tuple argument or as a series of integer
arguments.

Custom AbstractArray subtypes may choose which specific array type is
best-suited to return for the given element type and dimensionality. If they do
not specialize this method, the default is an `Array(element_type, dims...)`.

For example, `similar(1:10, 1, 4)` returns an uninitialized `Array{Int,2}` since
ranges are neither mutable nor support 2 dimensions:

    julia> similar(1:10, 1, 4)
    1x4 Array{Int64,2}:
     4419743872  4374413872  4419743888  0

Conversely, `similar(trues(10,10), 2)` returns an uninitialized `BitVector`
with two elements since `BitArray`s are both mutable and can support
1-dimensional arrays:

    julia> similar(trues(10,10), 2)
    2-element BitArray{1}:
     false
     false

Since `BitArray`s can only store elements of type `Bool`, however, if you
request a different element type it will create a regular `Array` instead:

    julia> similar(falses(10), Float64, 2, 4)
    2x4 Array{Float64,2}:
     2.18425e-314  2.18425e-314  2.18425e-314  2.18425e-314

    writemime(stream, mime, x)

The `display` functions ultimately call `writemime` in order to write an object `x` as a given `mime` type to a given I/O `stream` (usually a memory buffer), if possible. In order to provide a rich multimedia representation of a user-defined type `T`, it is only necessary to define a new `writemime` method for `T`, via: `writemime(stream, ::MIME"mime", x::T) = ...`, where `mime` is a MIME-type string and the function body calls `write` (or similar) to write that representation of `x` to `stream`. (Note that the `MIME""` notation only supports literal strings; to construct `MIME` types in a more flexible manner use `MIME{symbol("")}`.)

For example, if you define a `MyImage` type and know how to write it to a PNG file, you could define a function `writemime(stream, ::MIME"image/png", x::MyImage) = ...` to allow your images to be displayed on any PNG-capable `Display` (such as IJulia). As usual, be sure to `import Base.writemime` in order to add new methods to the built-in Julia function `writemime`.

Technically, the `MIME"mime"` macro defines a singleton type for the given `mime` string, which allows us to exploit Julia's dispatch mechanisms in determining how to display objects of any given type.

For vectors, ``p`` can assume any numeric value (even though not all values produce a mathematically valid vector norm). In particular, ``norm(A, Inf)`` returns the largest value in ``abs(A)``, whereas ``norm(A, -Inf)`` returns the smallest.

For matrices, the matrix norm induced by the vector ``p``-norm is used, where valid values of ``p`` are ``1``, ``2``, or ``Inf``. (Note that for sparse matrices, ``p=2`` is currently not implemented.) Use :func:`vecnorm` to compute the Frobenius norm.

Concatenate the input arrays along the specified dimensions in the iterable `dims`. For dimensions not in `dims`, all input arrays should have the same size, which will also be the size of the output array along that dimension.

If `dims` is a single number, the different arrays are tightly stacked along that dimension. If `dims` is an iterable containing several dimensions, this allows to construct block diagonal matrices and their higher-dimensional analogues by simultaneously increasing several dimensions for every new input array and putting zero blocks elsewhere. For example, `cat([1,2], matrices...)` builds a block diagonal matrix, i.e. a block matrix with `matrices[1]`, `matrices[2]`, ... as diagonal blocks and matching zero blocks away from the diagonal.

`isequal` is the comparison function used by hash tables (`Dict`). `isequal(x,y)` must imply that `hash(x) == hash(y)`.

This typically means that if you define your own `==` function then you must define a corresponding `hash` (and vice versa). Collections typically implement `isequal` by calling `isequal` recursively on all contents.

For Hermitian ``A`` (equivalent to symmetric ``A`` for non-complex ``A``) the ``BunchKaufman`` factorization is used.  Otherwise an LU factorization is used. For rectangular ``A`` the result is the minimum-norm least squares solution computed by a pivoted QR factorization of ``A`` and a rank estimate of ``A`` based on the R factor.

When ``A`` is sparse, a similar polyalgorithm is used. For indefinite matrices, the ``LDLt`` factorization does not use pivoting during the numerical factorization and therefore the procedure can fail even for invertible matrices.

The following functions are available for the ``QR`` objects: ``size``, ``\``. When ``A`` is rectangular, ``\`` will return a least squares solution and if the solution is not unique, the one with smallest norm is returned.

Multiplication with respect to either thin or full ``Q`` is allowed, i.e. both ``F[:Q]*F[:R]`` and ``F[:Q]*A`` are supported. A ``Q`` matrix can be converted into a regular matrix with :func:`full` which has a named argument ``thin``.

.. note::

   ``qrfact`` returns multiple types because LAPACK uses several representations that minimize the memory storage requirements of products of Householder elementary reflectors, so that the ``Q`` and ``R`` matrices can be stored compactly rather as two separate dense matrices.

   The data contained in ``QR`` or ``QRPivoted`` can be used to construct the ``QRPackedQ`` type, which is a compact representation of the rotation matrix:

   .. math::

      Q = \prod_{i=1}^{\min(m,n)} (I - \tau_i v_i v_i^T)

   where :math:`\tau_i` is the scale factor and :math:`v_i` is the projection vector associated with the :math:`i^{th}` Householder elementary reflector.

   The data contained in ``QRCompactWY`` can be used to construct the ``QRCompactWYQ`` type, which is a compact representation of the rotation matrix

   .. math::

      Q = I + Y T Y^T

   where ``Y`` is :math:`m \times r` lower trapezoidal and ``T`` is :math:`r \times r` upper triangular. The *compact WY* representation [Schreiber1989]_ is not to be confused with the older, *WY* representation [Bischof1987]_. (The LAPACK documentation uses ``V`` in lieu of ``Y``.)

    quadgk(f, a,b,c...; reltol=sqrt(eps), abstol=0, maxevals=10^7, order=7, norm=vecnorm)

Numerically integrate the function `f(x)` from `a` to `b`, and optionally over additional intervals `b` to `c` and so on. Keyword options include a relative error tolerance `reltol` (defaults to `sqrt(eps)` in the precision of the endpoints), an absolute error tolerance `abstol` (defaults to 0), a maximum number of function evaluations `maxevals` (defaults to `10^7`), and the `order` of the integration rule (defaults to 7).

Returns a pair `(I,E)` of the estimated integral `I` and an estimated upper bound on the absolute error `E`. If `maxevals` is not exceeded then `E <= max(abstol, reltol*norm(I))` will hold. (Note that it is useful to specify a positive `abstol` in cases where `norm(I)` may be zero.)

The endpoints `a` etcetera can also be complex (in which case the integral is performed over straight-line segments in the complex plane). If the endpoints are `BigFloat`, then the integration will be performed in `BigFloat` precision as well (note: it is advisable to increase the integration `order` in rough proportion to the precision, for smooth integrands). More generally, the precision is set by the precision of the integration endpoints (promoted to floating-point types).

The integrand `f(x)` can return any numeric scalar, vector, or matrix type, or in fact any type supporting `+`, `-`, multiplication by real values, and a `norm` (i.e., any normed vector space). Alternatively, a different norm can be specified by passing a `norm`-like function as the `norm` keyword argument (which defaults to `vecnorm`).

\[Only one-dimensional integrals are provided by this function. For multi-dimensional integration (cubature), there are many different algorithms (often much better than simple nested 1d integrals) and the optimal choice tends to be very problem-dependent. See the Julia external-package listing for available algorithms for multidimensional integration or other specialized tasks (such as integrals of highly oscillatory or singular functions).\]

The algorithm is an adaptive Gauss-Kronrod integration technique: the integral in each interval is estimated using a Kronrod rule (`2*order+1` points) and the error is estimated using an embedded Gauss rule (`order` points). The interval with the largest error is then subdivided into two intervals and the process is repeated until the desired error tolerance is achieved.

These quadrature rules work best for smooth functions within each interval, so if your function has a known discontinuity or other singularity, it is best to subdivide your interval to put the singularity at an endpoint. For example, if `f` has a discontinuity at `x=0.7` and you want to integrate from 0 to 1, you should use `quadgk(f, 0,0.7,1)` to subdivide the interval at the point of discontinuity. The integrand is never evaluated exactly at the endpoints of the intervals, so it is possible to integrate functions that diverge at the endpoints as long as the singularity is integrable (for example, a `log(x)` or `1/sqrt(x)` singularity).

For real-valued endpoints, the starting and/or ending points may be infinite. (A coordinate transformation is performed internally to map the infinite interval to a finite one.)

If `all` is `true` (the default), this function will block repeatedly trying to read all requested bytes, until an error or end-of-file occurs. If `all` is `false`, at most one `read` call is performed, and the amount of data returned is device-dependent. Note that not all stream types support the `all` option.

    deepcopy(x)

Create a deep copy of `x`: everything is copied recursively, resulting in a fully independent object. For example, deep-copying an array produces a new array whose elements are deep copies of the original elements. Calling `deepcopy` on an object should generally have the same effect as serializing and then deserializing it.

As a special case, functions can only be actually deep-copied if they are anonymous, otherwise they are just copied. The difference is only relevant in the case of closures, i.e. functions which may contain hidden internal references.

While it isn't normally necessary, user-defined types can override the default `deepcopy` behavior by defining a specialized version of the function `deepcopy_internal(x::T, dict::ObjectIdDict)` (which shouldn't otherwise be used), where `T` is the type to be specialized for, and `dict` keeps track of objects copied so far within the recursion. Within the definition, `deepcopy_internal` should be used in place of `deepcopy`, and the `dict` variable should be updated as appropriate before returning.
