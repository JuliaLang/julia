    utf32(s)

Create a UTF-32 string from a byte array, array of `Char` or `UInt32`, or any other string
type. (Conversions of byte arrays check for a byte-order marker in the first four bytes, and
do not include it in the resulting string.)

Note that the resulting `UTF32String` data is terminated by the NUL codepoint (32-bit zero),
which is not treated as a character in the string (so that it is mostly invisible in Julia);
this allows the string to be passed directly to external functions requiring NUL-terminated
data. This NUL is appended automatically by the `utf32(s)` conversion function. If you have
a `Char` or `UInt32` array `A` that is already NUL-terminated UTF-32 data, then you can
instead use `UTF32String(A)` to construct the string without making a copy of the data and
treating the NUL as a terminator rather than as part of the string.

    Mmap.mmap(io::Union{IOStream,AbstractString,Mmap.AnonymousMmap}[, type::Type{Array{T,N}}, dims, offset]; grow::Bool=true, shared::Bool=true)
           Mmap.mmap(type::Type{Array{T,N}}, dims)

Create an `Array` whose values are linked to a file, using memory-mapping. This provides a
convenient way of working with data too large to fit in the computer's memory.

The type is an `Array{T,N}` with a bits-type element of `T` and dimension `N` that
determines how the bytes of the array are interpreted. Note that the file must be stored in
binary format, and no format conversions are possible (this is a limitation of operating
systems, not Julia).

`dims` is a tuple or single `Integer` specifying the size or length of the array.

The file is passed via the stream argument, either as an open `IOStream` or filename string.
When you initialize the stream, use `"r"` for a "read-only" array, and `"w+"` to create a
new array used to write values to disk.

If no `type` argument is specified, the default is `Vector{UInt8}`.

Optionally, you can specify an offset (in bytes) if, for example, you want to skip over a
header in the file. The default value for the offset is the current stream position for an
`IOStream`.

The `grow` keyword argument specifies whether the disk file should be grown to accommodate
the requested size of array (if the total file size is < requested array size). Write
privileges are required to grow the file.

The `shared` keyword argument specifies whether the resulting `Array` and changes made to it
will be visible to other processes mapping the same file.

For example, the following code

```julia
# Create a file for mmapping
# (you could alternatively use mmap to do this step, too)
A = rand(1:20, 5, 30)
s = open("/tmp/mmap.bin", "w+")
# We'll write the dimensions of the array as the first two Ints in the file
write(s, size(A,1))
write(s, size(A,2))
# Now write the data
write(s, A)
close(s)

# Test by reading it back in
s = open("/tmp/mmap.bin")   # default is read-only
m = read(s, Int)
n = read(s, Int)
A2 = Mmap.mmap(s, Matrix{Int}, (m,n))
```

creates a `m`-by-`n` `Matrix{Int}`, linked to the file associated with stream `s`.

A more portable file would need to encode the word size -- 32 bit or 64 bit -- and endianness
information in the header. In practice, consider encoding binary data using standard formats
like HDF5 (which can be used with memory-mapping).

```jldoctest

The optional [`RoundingMode`](:obj:`RoundingMode`) argument will change how the number gets
rounded.

`round(T, x, [r::RoundingMode])` converts the result to type `T`, throwing an
[`InexactError`](:exc:`InexactError`) if the value is not representable.

`round(x, digits)` rounds to the specified number of digits after the decimal place (or

Rounding to specified digits in bases other than 2 can be inexact when operating on binary

Reduce the given collection `ìtr` with the given binary operator `op`. `v0` must be a

Reductions for certain commonly-used operators have special implementations which should be

should be evaluated as `(1-2)-3` or `1-(2-3)`. Use `foldl` or `foldr` instead for guaranteed

    eachindex(A...)

Creates an iterable object for visiting each index of an AbstractArray `A` in an efficient
manner. For array types that have opted into fast linear indexing (like `Array`), this is
simply the range `1:length(A)`. For other array types, this returns a specialized Cartesian
range to efficiently index into the array with indices specified for every dimension. For
other iterables, including strings and dictionaries, this returns an iterator object
supporting arbitrary index types (e.g. unevenly spaced or non-integer indices).

Example for a sparse 2-d array:

```jldoctest
julia> A = sparse([1, 1, 2], [1, 3, 1], [1, 2, -5])
2x3 sparse matrix with 3 Int64 entries:

If you supply more than one `AbstractArray` argument, `eachindex` will create an

"""
```
addprocs(machines; keyword_args...) -> List of process identifiers
```

Add processes on remote machines via SSH. Requires julia to be installed in the same
location on each node, or to be available via a shared file system.

`machines` is a vector of machine specifications.  Worker are started for each specification.

A machine specification is either a string `machine_spec` or a tuple - `(machine_spec, count)`.

`machine_spec` is a string of the form `[user@]host[:port] [bind_addr[:port]]`. `user` defaults
to current user, `port` to the standard ssh port. If `[bind_addr[:port]]` is specified, other
workers will connect to this worker at the specified `bind_addr` and `port`.

`count` is the number of workers to be launched on the specified host. If specified as `:auto`
it will launch as many workers as the number of cores on the specific host.


Keyword arguments:

* `tunnel`: if `true` then SSH tunneling will be used to connect to the worker from the
            master process. Default is `false`.

* `sshflags`: specifies additional ssh options, e.g.

    sshflags=`-i /home/foo/bar.pem`

* `max_parallel`: specifies the maximum number of workers connected to in parallel at a host.
                  Defaults to 10.

* `dir`: specifies the working directory on the workers. Defaults to the host's current
         directory (as found by `pwd()`)

* `exename`: name of the julia executable. Defaults to `"\$JULIA_HOME/julia"` or
             `"\$JULIA_HOME/julia-debug"` as the case may be.

* `exeflags`: additional flags passed to the worker processes.

* `topology`: Specifies how the workers connect to each other. Sending a message
            between unconnected workers results in an error.

  + `topology=:all_to_all`  :  All processes are connected to each other.
                      This is the default.

  + `topology=:master_slave`  :  Only the driver process, i.e. pid 1 connects to the
                        workers. The workers do not connect to each other.

  + `topology=:custom`  :  The `launch` method of the cluster manager specifes the
                  connection topology via fields `ident` and `connect_idents` in
                  `WorkerConfig`. A worker with a cluster manager identity `ident`
                  will connect to all workers specified in `connect_idents`.


Environment variables :

If the master process fails to establish a connection with a newly launched worker within
60.0 seconds, the worker treats it a fatal situation and terminates. This timeout can be
controlled via environment variable `JULIA_WORKER_TIMEOUT`. The value of
`JULIA_WORKER_TIMEOUT` on the master process, specifies the number of seconds a newly
launched worker waits for connection establishment.

Read a matrix from the source where each line (separated by `eol`) gives one row, with
elements separated by the given delimeter. The source can be a text file, stream or byte
array. Memory mapped files can be used by passing the byte array representation of the

    pinv(M[, tol])

Computes the Moore-Penrose pseudoinverse.

For matrices `M` with floating point elements, it is convenient to compute
the pseudoinverse by inverting only singular values above a given threshold,
`tol`.

The optimal choice of `tol` varies both with the value of `M` and the intended application
of the pseudoinverse. The default value of `tol` is
`eps(real(float(one(eltype(M)))))*maximum(size(A))`, which is essentially machine epsilon
for the real part of a matrix element multiplied by the larger matrix dimension. For
inverting dense ill-conditioned matrices in a least-squares sense,
`tol = sqrt(eps(real(float(one(eltype(M))))))` is recommended.

    similar(array, [element_type=eltype(array)], [dims=size(array)])

Create an uninitialized mutable array with the given element type and size, based upon the
given source array. The second and third arguments are both optional, defaulting to the
given array's `eltype` and `size`. The dimensions may be specified either as a single tuple
argument or as a series of integer arguments.

Custom AbstractArray subtypes may choose which specific array type is best-suited to return
for the given element type and dimensionality. If they do not specialize this method, the
default is an `Array(element_type, dims...)`.

For example, `similar(1:10, 1, 4)` returns an uninitialized `Array{Int,2}` since ranges are
neither mutable nor support 2 dimensions:

    julia> similar(1:10, 1, 4)
    1x4 Array{Int64,2}:
     4419743872  4374413872  4419743888  0

Conversely, `similar(trues(10,10), 2)` returns an uninitialized `BitVector` with two
elements since `BitArray`s are both mutable and can support 1-dimensional arrays:

    julia> similar(trues(10,10), 2)
    2-element BitArray{1}:
     false
     false

Since `BitArray`s can only store elements of type `Bool`, however, if you request a
different element type it will create a regular `Array` instead:

    julia> similar(falses(10), Float64, 2, 4)
    2x4 Array{Float64,2}:
     2.18425e-314  2.18425e-314  2.18425e-314  2.18425e-314

    writemime(stream, mime, x)

The `display` functions ultimately call `writemime` in order to write an object `x` as a
given `mime` type to a given I/O `stream` (usually a memory buffer), if possible. In order
to provide a rich multimedia representation of a user-defined type `T`, it is only necessary
to define a new `writemime` method for `T`, via: `writemime(stream, ::MIME"mime", x::T) = ...`,
where `mime` is a MIME-type string and the function body calls `write` (or similar) to write
that representation of `x` to `stream`. (Note that the `MIME""` notation only supports
literal strings; to construct `MIME` types in a more flexible manner use
`MIME{symbol("")}`.)

For example, if you define a `MyImage` type and know how to write it to a PNG file, you

    qrfact(A [,pivot=Val{false}]) -> F

| Return type   | `eltype(A)`     | `pivot`      | Relationship between `F` and `A` |
|:--------------|:----------------|:-------------|:---------------------------------|

| `QRPivoted`   | `BlasFloat`     | `Val{true}`  | `A[:,F[:p]]==F[:Q]*F[:R]`        |

`BlasFloat` refers to any of: `Float32`, `Float64`, `Complex64` or `Complex128`.

The individual components of the factorization `F` can be accessed by indexing:

| Component | Description                               | `QR`            | `QRCompactWY`      | `QRPivoted`     |
|:----------|:------------------------------------------|:----------------|:-------------------|:----------------|
| `F[:Q]`   | `Q` (orthogonal/unitary) part of `QR`     | ✓ (`QRPackedQ`) | ✓ (`QRCompactWYQ`) | ✓ (`QRPackedQ`) |
| `F[:R]`   | `R` (upper right triangular) part of `QR` | ✓               | ✓                  | ✓               |
| `F[:p]`   | pivot `Vector`                            |                 |                    | ✓               |

The following functions are available for the `QR` objects: `size`, `\\`. When `A` is
rectangular, `\\` will return a least squares solution and if the solution is not unique,
the one with smallest norm is returned.

Multiplication with respect to either thin or full `Q` is allowed, i.e. both `F[:Q]*F[:R]`
and `F[:Q]*A` are supported. A `Q` matrix can be converted into a regular matrix with
[`full`](:func:`full`) which has a named argument `thin`.

**note**

`qrfact` returns multiple types because LAPACK uses several representations that minimize
the memory storage requirements of products of Householder elementary reflectors, so that
the `Q` and `R` matrices can be stored compactly rather as two separate dense matrices.

The data contained in `QR` or `QRPivoted` can be used to construct the `QRPackedQ` type,
which is a compact representation of the rotation matrix:

```math
Q = \\prod_{i=1}^{\\min(m,n)} (I - \\tau_i v_i v_i^T)
```

where ``\\tau_i`` is the scale factor and ``v_i`` is the projection vector associated with
the ``i^{th}`` Householder elementary reflector.

The data contained in `QRCompactWY` can be used to construct the `QRCompactWYQ` type,
which is a compact representation of the rotation matrix

```math
Q = I + Y T Y^T
```

where `Y` is ``m \\times r`` lower trapezoidal and `T` is ``r \\times r`` upper
triangular. The *compact WY* representation [^Schreiber1989] is not to be confused with the
older, *WY* representation [^Bischof1987]. (The LAPACK documentation uses `V` in lieu of `Y`.)

For general nonsymmetric matrices it is possible to specify how the matrix is balanced

make rows and columns more equal in norm. The default is `true` for both options.

    quadgk(f, a,b,c...; reltol=sqrt(eps), abstol=0, maxevals=10^7, order=7, norm=vecnorm)

Numerically integrate the function `f(x)` from `a` to `b`, and optionally over additional
intervals `b` to `c` and so on. Keyword options include a relative error tolerance `reltol`
(defaults to `sqrt(eps)` in the precision of the endpoints), an absolute error tolerance
`abstol` (defaults to 0), a maximum number of function evaluations `maxevals` (defaults to
`10^7`), and the `order` of the integration rule (defaults to 7).

Returns a pair `(I,E)` of the estimated integral `I` and an estimated upper bound on the
absolute error `E`. If `maxevals` is not exceeded then `E <= max(abstol, reltol*norm(I))`
will hold. (Note that it is useful to specify a positive `abstol` in cases where `norm(I)`
may be zero.)

The endpoints `a` etcetera can also be complex (in which case the integral is performed over
straight-line segments in the complex plane). If the endpoints are `BigFloat`, then the
integration will be performed in `BigFloat` precision as well (note: it is advisable to
increase the integration `order` in rough proportion to the precision, for smooth
integrands). More generally, the precision is set by the precision of the integration
endpoints (promoted to floating-point types).

The integrand `f(x)` can return any numeric scalar, vector, or matrix type, or in fact any
type supporting `+`, `-`, multiplication by real values, and a `norm` (i.e., any normed
vector space). Alternatively, a different norm can be specified by passing a `norm`-like
function as the `norm` keyword argument (which defaults to `vecnorm`).

\[Only one-dimensional integrals are provided by this function. For multi-dimensional
integration (cubature), there are many different algorithms (often much better than simple
nested 1d integrals) and the optimal choice tends to be very problem-dependent. See the
Julia external-package listing for available algorithms for multidimensional integration or
other specialized tasks (such as integrals of highly oscillatory or singular functions).\]

The algorithm is an adaptive Gauss-Kronrod integration technique: the integral in each
interval is estimated using a Kronrod rule (`2*order+1` points) and the error is estimated
using an embedded Gauss rule (`order` points). The interval with the largest error is then
subdivided into two intervals and the process is repeated until the desired error tolerance
is achieved.

These quadrature rules work best for smooth functions within each interval, so if your
function has a known discontinuity or other singularity, it is best to subdivide your
interval to put the singularity at an endpoint. For example, if `f` has a discontinuity at
`x=0.7` and you want to integrate from 0 to 1, you should use `quadgk(f, 0,0.7,1)` to
subdivide the interval at the point of discontinuity. The integrand is never evaluated
exactly at the endpoints of the intervals, so it is possible to integrate functions that
diverge at the endpoints as long as the singularity is integrable (for example, a `log(x)`
or `1/sqrt(x)` singularity).

For real-valued endpoints, the starting and/or ending points may be infinite. (A coordinate
transformation is performed internally to map the infinite interval to a finite one.)

As a special case, functions can only be actually deep-copied if they are anonymous,
otherwise they are just copied. The difference is only relevant in the case of closures,
i.e. functions which may contain hidden internal references.

While it isn't normally necessary, user-defined types can override the default `deepcopy`
behavior by defining a specialized version of the function `deepcopy_internal(x::T, dict::ObjectIdDict)`
(which shouldn't otherwise be used), where `T` is the type to be specialized for, and `dict`
