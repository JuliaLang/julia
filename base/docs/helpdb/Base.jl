           Mmap.mmap(type::Type{Array{T,N}}, dims)

Create an `Array` whose values are linked to a file, using memory-mapping. This provides a
convenient way of working with data too large to fit in the computer's memory.

The type is an `Array{T,N}` with a bits-type element of `T` and dimension `N` that
determines how the bytes of the array are interpreted. Note that the file must be stored in
binary format, and no format conversions are possible (this is a limitation of operating
systems, not Julia).

`dims` is a tuple or single `Integer` specifying the size or length of the array.

The file is passed via the stream argument, either as an open `IOStream` or filename string.
When you initialize the stream, use `"r"` for a "read-only" array, and `"w+"` to create a
new array used to write values to disk.

If no `type` argument is specified, the default is `Vector{UInt8}`.

Optionally, you can specify an offset (in bytes) if, for example, you want to skip over a
header in the file. The default value for the offset is the current stream position for an
`IOStream`.

The `grow` keyword argument specifies whether the disk file should be grown to accommodate
the requested size of array (if the total file size is < requested array size). Write
privileges are required to grow the file.

The `shared` keyword argument specifies whether the resulting `Array` and changes made to it
will be visible to other processes mapping the same file.

For example, the following code

```julia
# Create a file for mmapping
# (you could alternatively use mmap to do this step, too)
A = rand(1:20, 5, 30)
s = open("/tmp/mmap.bin", "w+")
# We'll write the dimensions of the array as the first two Ints in the file
write(s, size(A,1))
write(s, size(A,2))
# Now write the data
write(s, A)
close(s)

# Test by reading it back in
s = open("/tmp/mmap.bin")   # default is read-only
m = read(s, Int)
n = read(s, Int)
A2 = Mmap.mmap(s, Matrix{Int}, (m,n))
```

creates a `m`-by-`n` `Matrix{Int}`, linked to the file associated with stream `s`.

A more portable file would need to encode the word size -- 32 bit or 64 bit -- and endianness
information in the header. In practice, consider encoding binary data using standard formats
like HDF5 (which can be used with memory-mapping).
"""
Mmap.mmap(io, ::Type, dims, offset)

"""
    Mmap.mmap(io, BitArray, [dims, offset])

the byte representation is different.

    show(stream, mime, x)

The `display` functions ultimately call `show` in order to write an object `x` as a
given `mime` type to a given I/O `stream` (usually a memory buffer), if possible. In order
to provide a rich multimedia representation of a user-defined type `T`, it is only necessary
to define a new `show` method for `T`, via: `show(stream, ::MIME"mime", x::T) = ...`,
where `mime` is a MIME-type string and the function body calls `write` (or similar) to write
that representation of `x` to `stream`. (Note that the `MIME""` notation only supports
literal strings; to construct `MIME` types in a more flexible manner use
`MIME{Symbol("")}`.)

For example, if you define a `MyImage` type and know how to write it to a PNG file, you
could define a function `show(stream, ::MIME"image/png", x::MyImage) = ...` to allow
your images to be displayed on any PNG-capable `Display` (such as IJulia). As usual, be sure
to `import Base.show` in order to add new methods to the built-in Julia function
`show`.

The default MIME type is `MIME"text/plain"`. There is a fallback definition for `text/plain`
output that calls `show` with 2 arguments. Therefore, this case should be handled by
defining a 2-argument `show(stream::IO, x::MyType)` method.

Technically, the `MIME"mime"` macro defines a singleton type for the given `mime` string,
which allows us to exploit Julia's dispatch mechanisms in determining how to display objects
of any given type.

The first argument to `show` can be an [`IOContext`](@ref) specifying output format properties.
See [`IOContext`](@ref) for details.

a single number, the different arrays are tightly stacked along that dimension. If `dims` is
an iterable containing several dimensions, this allows one to construct block diagonal
matrices and their higher-dimensional analogues by simultaneously increasing several
dimensions for every new input array and putting zero blocks elsewhere. For example,

    deepcopy(x)

Create a deep copy of `x`: everything is copied recursively, resulting in a fully
independent object. For example, deep-copying an array produces a new array whose elements
are deep copies of the original elements. Calling `deepcopy` on an object should generally
have the same effect as serializing and then deserializing it.

As a special case, functions can only be actually deep-copied if they are anonymous,
otherwise they are just copied. The difference is only relevant in the case of closures,
i.e. functions which may contain hidden internal references.

While it isn't normally necessary, user-defined types can override the default `deepcopy`
behavior by defining a specialized version of the function `deepcopy_internal(x::T, dict::ObjectIdDict)`
(which shouldn't otherwise be used), where `T` is the type to be specialized for, and `dict`
keeps track of objects copied so far within the recursion. Within the definition,
`deepcopy_internal` should be used in place of `deepcopy`, and the `dict` variable should be
updated as appropriate before returning.
