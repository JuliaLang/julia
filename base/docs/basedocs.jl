keywords[:using] = doc"""
  `using` will load the given module or package and make some of its names
  available for use (see also `export`). For example:

      using Gadfly

  loads the plotting package, Gadfly, so that the `plot` function can be used.

  Names can be used via dot syntax, whether they are exported or not:

      Gadfly.plot(...)

  If you don't want to use the packages exports directly, see also `import`.
  If you're not sure, `using` is almost definitely what you want.
  """

keywords[:import] = doc"""
      import Gadfly

  `import`, like `using`, will load modules and packages for use. Unlike
  `using`, however, it will *not* make any `export`ed names available for use.
  To use Gadfly's `plot` function after importing it, for example, you have
  to write:

      Gadfly.plot(...)

  Import can also be used with specific names, for example

      import Gadfly: plot, render

  This syntax is used when you want to extend the modules functions with
  new methods.
  """

keywords[:export] = doc"""
  `export` is used within modules and packages to tell Julia which functions
  should be made available to the user. For example:

      module Test
      export foo # foo is exported, but bar isn't
      foo(x) = x
      bar(y) = y
      end

      using Test
      foo(1) # 1
      bar(1) # Error: bar not defined
      Test.bar(1) # 1
  """

keywords[:const] = doc"""
  `const` is used to declare global variables which are also constant.
  In almost all code (and particularly performance sensitive code)
  global variables should be declared constant in this way.

      const x = 5

  Note that "constant-ness" is not enforced inside containers, so if
  `x` is an array or dictionary (for example) you can still add and remove
  elements.

  Technically, you can even redefine `const` variables, although this will
  generate a warning from the compiler. The only strict requirement is that
  the *type* of the variable does not change, which is why `const` variables
  are much faster than regular globals.
  """

keywords[:function] = doc"""
  Functions are defined with the `function` keyword:

      function add(a, b)
        return a + b
      end

  Or the short form notation:

      add(a, b) = a + b

  The use of the `return` keyword is exactly the same as in other languages,
  but is often optional. When it's not used, the last expression in the function
  body will be returned by default:

      function compare(a, b)
        a == b && return "equal to"
        a < b ? "less than" : "greater than"
      end
  """

keywords[:return] = doc"""
  `return` can be used function bodies to exit early and return a given value,
  e.g.

      function compare(a, b)
        a == b && return "equal to"
        a < b ? "less than" : "greater than"
      end

  In general you can place a `return` statement anywhere within a function
  body, including within deeply nested loops or conditionals, but be careful
  with `do` blocks. For example:

      function test1(xs)
        for x in xs
          iseven(x) && return 2x
        end
      end

      function test2(xs)
        map(xs) do x
          iseven(x) && return 2x
          x
        end
      end

  In the first example, the return breaks out of its enclosing function
  as soon as it hits an even number, so `test1([5,6,7])` returns `12`.

  You might expect the second example to behave the same way, but in fact
  the `return` there only breaks out of the *inner* function (inside the `do`
  block) and gives a value back to `map`. `test2([5,6,7])` then returns `[5,12,7]`.
  """

keywords[:break] = doc"""
  `break` breaks out of a loop immediately. For example

      i = 0
      while true
        i += 1
        i > 10 && break
        println(i)
      end

  prints the numbers 1 to 10.
  """

keywords[:continue] = doc"""
  `continue` skips the rest of the current loop, then carries on
  looping. For example

      for i = 1:10
        iseven(i) && continue
        println(i)
      end

  prints the numbers 1, 3, 5..., skipping the even numbers.
  """

keywords[:do] = doc"""
  The `do` keyword creates an anonymous function. For example

      map(1:10) do x
        2x
      end

  is equivalent to `map(x->2x, 1:10)`.

  Use multiple arguments like so:

      map(1:10, 10:20) do x, y
        x + y
      end

  Splats (`...`) are not supported in do block notation yet.
  """

keywords[:...] = doc"""
  The "splat" operator, `...`, represents a sequence of arguments. For example

      add(xs...) = reduce(+, xs)

  can take any number of arguments:

      add(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)

  `...` can also be used to apply a function to a sequence of arguments like so:

      add([1, 2, 3]...) # 6
      add(7, 1:100..., 1000:1100...) # 111107
  """

keywords[symbol(";")] = doc"""
  `;` has a similar role in Julia as in many C-like languages,
  and is used to delimit the end of the previous statement.
  `;` is not necessary after new lines, but can be used to
  seperate statements on a single line or to join statements into
  a single expression:

      function foo()
        println("Hello, "); println("World!")
        return true
      end

      foo() = (println("Hello, World!"); true)

    `;` is also used to suppress output in the REPL and similar
    interfaces.
  """

keywords[:ccall] = doc"""
      ccall((symbol, library) or function_pointer, ReturnType,
            (ArgumentType1, ...),
            ArgumentValue1, ...)

  Call function in C-exported shared library, specified by
  `(function name, library)` tuple, where each component is a string
  or symbol.

  Note that the argument type tuple must be a literal tuple, and not
  a tuple-valued variable or expression. Alternatively, `ccall` may
  also be used to call a function pointer, such as one returned by
  `dlsym`.

  Each `ArgumentValue` to the `ccall` will be converted to the
  corresponding `ArgumentType`, by automatic insertion of calls to
  `unsafe_convert(ArgumentType, cconvert(ArgumentType,
  ArgumentValue))`. (See also the documentation for each of these
  functions for further details.) In most cases, this simply results
  in a call to `convert(ArgumentType, ArgumentValue)`.
  """

keywords[:begin] = doc"""
  `begin...end` denotes a block of code.

      begin
        println("Hello, ")
        println("World!")
      end

  Usually `begin` will not be necessary, since keywords
  such as `function` and `let` implicitly begin blocks of
  code. See also `;`.
  """

keywords[:type] = doc"""
  At their most basic, Julia types are specified as a name
  and a set of fields.

      type Point
        x
        y
      end

  Fields can have type restrictions, which may be parametised:

      type Point{X}
        x::X
        y::Float64
      end

  Type can also declare an abstract super type via `<:` syntax:

      type Point <: AbstractPoint
        ...

  See the manual for more details, such as information on
  inner constructors.
  """

keywords[:immutable] = doc"""
  `immutable` acts in the same way as `type`, but declares
  that the fields of the type may not be set after construction.
  See `type` and the manual for more information.

doc"""
Construct a regex, such as `r"^[a-z]*$"`. The regex also accepts
one or more flags, listed after the ending quote, to change its
behaviour:

  • `i` enables case-insensitive matching
  • `m` treats the `^` and `$` tokens as matching the start and
    and end of individual lines, as opposed to the whole string.
  • `s` allows the `.` modifier to match newlines.
  • `x` enables "comment mode": whitespace is enabled except when
    escaped with `\`, and `#` is treated as starting a comment.

For example, this regex has all three flags enabled:

    julia> match(r"a+.*b+.*?d$"ism, "Goodbye,\nOh, angry,\nBad world\n")
    RegexMatch("angry,\nBad world")

    fft(A [, dims])

Performs a multidimensional FFT of the array `A`.  The optional
`dims` argument specifies an iterable subset of dimensions (e.g.
an integer, range, tuple, or array) to transform along.  Most
efficient if the size of `A` along the transformed dimensions is
a product of small primes; see `nextprod()`.  See also
`plan_fft()` for even greater efficiency.

A one-dimensional FFT computes the one-dimensional discrete Fourier
transform (DFT) as defined by

$$\operatorname{DFT}(A)[k] =
  \sum_{n=1}^{\operatorname{length}(A)}
  \exp\left(-i\frac{2\pi
  (n-1)(k-1)}{\operatorname{length}(A)} \right) A[n].$$

A multidimensional FFT simply performs this operation along each
transformed dimension of `A`.

Higher performance is usually possible with multi-threading. Use
`FFTW.set_num_threads(np)` to use `np` threads, if you have `np`
processors.

    include(path::AbstractString)

Evaluate the contents of a source file in the current context.
During including, a task-local include path is set to the directory
containing the file. Nested calls to `include` will search
relative to that path. All paths refer to files on node 1 when
running in parallel, and files will be fetched from node 1. This
function is typically used to load source interactively, or to
combine files in packages that are broken into multiple source
files.

0 (zero; BrE: `/ˈzɪərəʊ/` or AmE: `/ˈziːroʊ/`) is both a number and the numerical digit used to represent that number in numerals. It fulfills a central role in mathematics as the additive identity of the integers, real numbers, and many other algebraic structures. As a digit, 0 is used as a placeholder in place value systems. Names for the number 0 in English include zero, nought or (US) naught (`/ˈnɔːt/`), nil, or — in contexts where at least one adjacent digit distinguishes it from the letter "O" — oh or o (`/ˈoʊ/`). Informal or slang terms for zero include zilch and zip. Ought and aught (/ˈɔːt/), as well as cipher, have also been used historically.
