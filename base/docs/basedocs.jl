`using` will load the given module or package and make some of its names available for
use (see also `export`). For example:

    using Gadfly

loads the plotting package, Gadfly, so that the `plot` function can be used.

Names can be used via dot syntax, whether they are exported or not:

    Gadfly.plot(...)

If you don't want to use the packages exports directly, see also `import`. If you're not
sure, `using` is almost definitely what you want.
"""
kw"using"

"""
    import Gadfly

`import`, like `using`, will load modules and packages for use. Unlike `using`, however,
it will *not* make any `export`ed names available for use. To use Gadfly's `plot`
function after importing it, for example, you have to write:

    Gadfly.plot(...)

Import can also be used with specific names, for example

    import Gadfly: plot, render

This syntax is used when you want to extend the modules functions with new methods.
"""

`export` is used within modules and packages to tell Julia which functions should be
made available to the user. For example:

    module Test
    export foo # foo is exported, but bar isn't
    foo(x) = x
    bar(y) = y
    end

    using Test
    foo(1) # 1
    bar(1) # Error: bar not defined

`abstract type` declares a type that cannot be instantiated, and serves only as a node in the
type graph, thereby describing sets of related concrete types: those concrete types
which are their descendants. Abstract types form the conceptual hierarchy which makes
Julia’s type system more than just a collection of object implementations. For example:

    abstract type Number end
    abstract type Real <: Number end

[`Number`](@ref) has no supertype, whereas [`Real`](@ref) is an abstract subtype of `Number`.
"""
kw"abstract type"

"""
`module` declares a Module, which is a separate global variable workspace.  Within a
module, you can control which names from other modules are visible (via importing), and
specify which of your names are intended to be public (via exporting). For example:

    module
    import Base.show
    export MyType, foo

    type MyType
        x
    end

    bar(x) = 2x
    foo(a::MyType) = bar(a.x) + 1
    show(io, a::MyType) = print(io, "MyType \$(a.x)")
    end

Modules allow you to create top-level definitions without worrying about name conflicts
when your code is used together with somebody else’s.

`baremodule` declares a module that does not contain `using Base`
or a definition of `eval`.  It does still import `Core`.
"""
kw"baremodule"

"""
`primitive type` declares a concrete type whose data consists only of a series of bits. Classic
examples of primitive types are integers and floating-point values. Some example built-in
primitive type declarations:

    primitive type Char 32 end
    primitive type Bool <: Integer 8 end

The number after the name indicates how many bits of storage the type requires. Currently,
only sizes that are multiples of 8 bits are supported.
The [`Bool`](@ref) declaration shows how a primitive type can be optionally
declared to be a subtype of some supertype.
"""
kw"primitive type"

"""
`macro` defines a method to include generated code in the final body of a program. A
macro maps a tuple of arguments to a returned expression, and the resulting expression
is compiled directly rather than requiring a runtime `eval()` call. Macro arguments may
include expressions, literal values, and symbols. For example:

    macro sayhello(name)
        return :( println("Hello, ", \$name) )
    end

This macro takes one argument: `name`. When `@sayhello` is encountered, the quoted
expression is expanded to interpolate the value of the argument into the final
expression.
"""

"""
`importall` imports all names exported by the specified module, as if `import` were used
individually on all of them.  For example:

    importall Distributions

As with `import`, functions imported by `importall` can be extended.
"""
kw"importall"

`local` introduces a new local variable. For example:

    function foo(n)
        x = 0
        for i = 1:n
            local x
            x = i
        end
        x
    end

    julia> foo(10)
    0

Here `local x` introduces a separate `x` inside the loop, so the function returns `0`.
"""
kw"local"

"""
`global x` makes `x` in the current scope and its inner scopes refer to the global
variable of that name.   In the example below, `global` is needed so the function can
modify the global variable `z`:

    z=3
    function foo()
        global z=6
    end

    julia> foo()
    6
    julia> z
    6

Without the `global` declaration in `foo()`, a new local variable would have been
created inside foo(), and the `z` in the global scope would have remained equal to `3`.
"""
kw"global"

"""
`let` statements allocate new variable bindings each time they run. Whereas an
assignment modifies an existing value location, `let` creates new locations. This
difference is only detectable in the case of variables that outlive their scope via
closures. The `let` syntax accepts a comma-separated series of assignments and variable
names:

    let var1 = value1, var2, var3 = value3
        code
    end

The assignments are evaluated in order, with each right-hand side evaluated in the scope
before the new variable on the left-hand side has been introduced. Therefore it makes
sense to write something like `let x = x`, since the two `x` variables are distinct and
have separate storage.

`quote` creates multiple expression objects in a block without using the explicit `Expr`
constructor. For example:

    ex = quote
        x = 1
        y = 2
        x + y
    end

Unlike the other means of quoting, `:( ... )`, this form introduces `QuoteNode` elements
to the expression tree, which must be considered when directly manipulating the tree.
For other purposes, `:( ... )` and `quote .. end` blocks are treated identically.

`const` is used to declare global variables which are also constant. In almost all code
(and particularly performance sensitive code) global variables should be declared
constant in this way.

    const x = 5

Note that "constant-ness" is not enforced inside containers, so if `x` is an array or
dictionary (for example) you can still add and remove elements.

Technically, you can even redefine `const` variables, although this will generate a
warning from the compiler. The only strict requirement is that the *type* of the
variable does not change, which is why `const` variables are much faster than regular
globals.
"""
kw"const"

"""
Functions are defined with the `function` keyword:

    function add(a, b)
        return a + b
    end

Or the short form notation:

    add(a, b) = a + b

The use of the `return` keyword is exactly the same as in other languages, but is often
optional. When it's not used, the last expression in the function body will be returned
by default:

    function compare(a, b)
        a == b && return "equal to"
        a < b ? "less than" : "greater than"
    end
"""
kw"function"

"""
`return` can be used function bodies to exit early and return a given value, e.g.

    function compare(a, b)
        a == b && return "equal to"
        a < b ? "less than" : "greater than"
    end

In general you can place a `return` statement anywhere within a function body, including
within deeply nested loops or conditionals, but be careful with `do` blocks. For
example:

    function test1(xs)
        for x in xs
            iseven(x) && return 2x
        end
    end

    function test2(xs)
        map(xs) do x
            iseven(x) && return 2x
            x
        end
    end

In the first example, the return breaks out of its enclosing function as soon as it hits
an even number, so `test1([5,6,7])` returns `12`.

You might expect the second example to behave the same way, but in fact the `return`
there only breaks out of the *inner* function (inside the `do` block) and gives a value
back to `map`. `test2([5,6,7])` then returns `[5,12,7]`.
"""
kw"return"

"""
`if`-`elseif`-`else` performs conditional evaluation, which allows portions of code to
be evaluated or not evaluated depending on the value of a boolean expression. Here is
the anatomy of the `if`-`elseif`-`else` conditional syntax:

    if x < y
        println("x is less than y")
    elseif x > y
        println("x is greater than y")
    else
        println("x is equal to y")
    end

If the condition expression `x < y` is true, then the corresponding block is evaluated;
otherwise the condition expression `x > y` is evaluated, and if it is true, the
corresponding block is evaluated; if neither expression is true, the `else` block is
evaluated. The `elseif` and `else` blocks are optional, and as many `elseif` blocks as
desired can be used.

`for` loops repeatedly evaluate the body of the loop by iterating over a sequence of
values. For example:

    for i in [1,4,0]
        println(i)
    end
"""
kw"for"

"""
`while` loops repeatedly evaluate a conditional expression, and continues evaluating the
body of the while loop so long as the expression remains `true`. If the condition
expression is false when the while loop is first reached, the body is never evaluated.
For example:

    while i <= 5
        println(i)
        i += 1
    end
"""

"""
`end` marks the conclusion of a block of expressions. In the example below, `end` marks
the conclusion of a `function`.

    function foo()
        println("hello, world")
    end

`end` marks the conclusion of all kinds of expression blocks: `module`, `type`, `begin`,
`let`, `for`, etc.

In addition, `end` may be used when indexing into an array to represent the last index
of each dimension:

    x[1:end, 2:end-1]
"""
kw"end"

"""
A `try/catch` statement allows for `Exception`s to be tested for. For example, a
customized square root function can be written to automatically call either the real or
complex square root method on demand using `Exception`s:

    f(x) = try
        sqrt(x)
    catch
        sqrt(complex(x, 0))
    end

`try/catch` statements also allow the `Exception` to be saved in a variable, e.g. `catch y`.

The `catch` clause is not strictly necessary; when omitted, the default return value is
`nothing`. The power of the `try/catch` construct lies in the ability to unwind a deeply
nested computation immediately to a much higher level in the stack of calling functions.
"""

`finally` provides a way to run some code when a given block of code exits, regardless
of how it exits. For example, here is how we can guarantee that an opened file is
closed:

    f = open("file")
    try
        operate_on_file(f)
    finally
        close(f)
    end

When control leaves the `try` block (for example due to a `return`, or just finishing
normally), `close(f)` will be executed. If the `try` block exits due to an exception,
the exception will continue propagating. A `catch` block may be combined with `try` and
`finally` as well. In this case the `finally` block will run after `catch` has handled
the error.

`break` breaks out of a loop immediately. For example

    i = 0
    while true
        i += 1

    end

`continue` skips the rest of the current loop, then carries on looping. For example

        println(i)
    end

prints the numbers 1, 3, 5..., skipping the even numbers.

The `do` keyword creates an anonymous function. For example

The `where` keyword creates a type that is an iterated union of other types, over all

The variable bound defaults to `Any` if it is omitted:

Variables can also have lower bounds:

There is also a concise syntax for nested `where` expressions. For example, this:
