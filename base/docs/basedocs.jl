    module

`module` declares a [`Module`](@ref), which is a separate global variable workspace. Within a

specify which of your names are intended to be public (via exporting).
Modules allow you to create top-level definitions without worrying about name conflicts
when your code is used together with somebody else’s.

    __init__

`__init__()` function in your module would executes immediately *after* the module is loaded at
runtime for the first time (i.e., it is only called once and only after all statements in the
module have been executed). Because it is called *after* fully importing the module, `__init__`
functions of submodules will be executed *first*. Two typical uses of `__init__` are calling
runtime initialization functions of external C libraries and initializing global constants
that involve pointers returned by external libraries.

# Examples
```julia
const foo_data_ptr = Ref{Ptr{Cvoid}}(0)

    macro

`macro` defines a method for inserting generated code into a program.
A macro maps a sequence of argument expressions to a returned expression, and the
resulting expression is substituted directly into the program at the point where
the macro is invoked.
Macros are a way to run generated code without calling [`eval`](@ref Base.eval), since the generated
code instead simply becomes part of the surrounding program.
Macro arguments may include expressions, literal values, and symbols. Macros can be defined for
variable number of arguments (varargs), but do not accept keyword arguments.
Every macro also implicitly gets passed the arguments `__source__`, which contains the line number
and file name the macro is called from, and `__module__`, which is the module the macro is expanded
in.

# Examples
```jldoctest
julia> macro sayhello(name)
           return :( println("Hello, ", \$name, "!") )
       end

    =

`=` is the assignment operator.
* For variable `a` and expression `b`, `a = b` makes `a` refer to the value of `b`.
* For functions `f(x)`, `f(x) = x` defines a new function constant `f`, or adds a new method to `f` if `f` is already defined; this usage is equivalent to `function f(x); x; end`.
* `a[i] = v` calls [`setindex!`](@ref)`(a,v,i)`.
* `a.b = c` calls [`setproperty!`](@ref)`(a,:b,c)`.
* Inside a function call, `f(a=b)` passes `b` as the value of keyword argument `a`.
* Inside parentheses with commas, `(a=1,)` constructs a [`NamedTuple`](@ref).

# Examples
Assigning `a` to `b` does not create a copy of `b`; instead use [`copy`](@ref) or [`deepcopy`](@ref).

```jldoctest
julia> b = [1]; a = b; b[1] = 2; a
1-element Array{Int64, 1}:
 2

julia> b = [1]; a = copy(b); b[1] = 2; a
1-element Array{Int64, 1}:
 1

```
Collections passed to functions are also not copied. Functions can modify (mutate) the contents of the objects their arguments refer to. (The names of functions which do this are conventionally suffixed with '!'.)
```jldoctest
julia> function f!(x); x[:] .+= 1; end
f! (generic function with 1 method)

julia> a = [1]; f!(a); a
1-element Array{Int64, 1}:
 2

```
Assignment can operate on multiple variables in parallel, taking values from an iterable:
```jldoctest
julia> a, b = 4, 5
(4, 5)

julia> a, b = 1:3
1:3

julia> a, b
(1, 2)

```
Assignment can operate on multiple variables in series, and will return the value of the right-hand-most expression:
```jldoctest
julia> a = [1]; b = [2]; c = [3]; a = b = c
1-element Array{Int64, 1}:
 3

julia> b[1] = 2; a, b, c
([2], [2], [2])

```
Assignment at out-of-bounds indices does not grow a collection. If the collection is a [`Vector`](@ref) it can instead be grown with [`push!`](@ref) or [`append!`](@ref).
```jldoctest
julia> a = [1, 1]; a[3] = 2
ERROR: BoundsError: attempt to access 2-element Array{Int64, 1} at index [3]
[...]

julia> push!(a, 2, 3)
4-element Array{Int64, 1}:
 1
 1
 2
 3

```
Assigning `[]` does not eliminate elements from a collection; instead use [`filter!`](@ref).
```jldoctest
julia> a = collect(1:3); a[a .<= 1] = []
ERROR: DimensionMismatch("tried to assign 0 elements to 1 destinations")
[...]

julia> filter!(x -> x > 1, a) # in-place & thus more efficient than a = a[a .> 1]

    .=

Perform broadcasted assignment. The right-side argument is expanded as in
[`broadcast`](@ref) and then assigned into the left-side argument in-place.
Fuses with other dotted operators in the same expression; i.e. the whole
assignment expression is converted into a single loop.

`A .= B` is similar to `broadcast!(identity, A, B)`.

# Examples
```jldoctest
julia> A = zeros(4, 4); B = [1, 2, 3, 4];

julia> A .= B
4×4 Array{Float64, 2}:

    let

`let` statements create a new hard scope block and introduce new variable bindings
each time they run. Whereas assignments might reassign a new value to an existing value location,
`let` always creates a new location.
This difference is only detectable in the case of variables that outlive their scope via
closures. The `let` syntax accepts a comma-separated series of assignments and variable
names:

```julia
let var1 = value1, var2, var3 = value3
    code
end
```
The assignments are evaluated in order, with each right-hand side evaluated in the scope
before the new variable on the left-hand side has been introduced. Therefore it makes
sense to write something like `let x = x`, since the two `x` variables are distinct and
have separate storage.

end
```

    const

`const` is used to declare global variables whose values will not change. In almost all code
(and particularly performance sensitive code) global variables should be declared
constant in this way.

```julia
const x = 5
```

Multiple variables can be declared within a single `const`:
```julia
const y, z = 7, 11
```

Note that `const` only applies to one `=` operation, therefore `const x = y = 1`
declares `x` to be constant but not `y`. On the other hand, `const x = const y = 1`
declares both `x` and `y` constant.

Note that "constant-ness" does not extend into mutable containers; only the
association between a variable and its value is constant.
If `x` is an array or dictionary (for example) you can still modify, add, or remove elements.

In some cases changing the value of a `const` variable gives a warning instead of
an error.
However, this can produce unpredictable behavior or corrupt the state of your program,
and so should be avoided.
This feature is intended only for convenience during interactive use.
"""

    function

Functions are defined with the `function` keyword:

```julia

    return a + b

```
Or the short form notation:

```julia

The use of the [`return`](@ref) keyword is exactly the same as in other languages,
but is often optional. A function without an explicit `return` statement will return
the last expression in the function body.

    return

`return x` causes the enclosing function to exit early, passing the given value `x`
back to its caller. `return` by itself with no value is equivalent to `return nothing`
(see [`nothing`](@ref)).

```julia
function compare(a, b)
    a == b && return "equal to"
    a < b ? "less than" : "greater than"
end
```
In general you can place a `return` statement anywhere within a function body, including
within deeply nested loops or conditionals, but be careful with `do` blocks. For
example:

```julia
function test1(xs)
    for x in xs
        iseven(x) && return 2x
    end
end

function test2(xs)
    map(xs) do x
        iseven(x) && return 2x
        x
    end
end
```
In the first example, the return breaks out of `test1` as soon as it hits
an even number, so `test1([5,6,7])` returns `12`.

You might expect the second example to behave the same way, but in fact the `return`
there only breaks out of the *inner* function (inside the `do` block) and gives a value
back to `map`. `test2([5,6,7])` then returns `[5,12,7]`.

When used in a top-level expression (i.e. outside any function), `return` causes
the entire current top-level expression to terminate early.

    if/elseif/else

`if`/`elseif`/`else` performs conditional evaluation, which allows portions of code to
be evaluated or not evaluated depending on the value of a boolean expression. Here is
the anatomy of the `if`/`elseif`/`else` conditional syntax:

```julia
if x < y
    println("x is less than y")
elseif x > y
    println("x is greater than y")
else
    println("x is equal to y")

If the condition expression `x < y` is true, then the corresponding block is evaluated;
otherwise the condition expression `x > y` is evaluated, and if it is true, the
corresponding block is evaluated; if neither expression is true, the `else` block is
evaluated. The `elseif` and `else` blocks are optional, and as many `elseif` blocks as
desired can be used.

In contrast to some other languages conditions must be of type `Bool`. It does not
suffice for conditions to be convertible to `Bool`.

emphasize the value `b`-or-`c` which is being used as part of a larger

    try/catch

A `try`/`catch` statement allows intercepting errors (exceptions) thrown
by [`throw`](@ref) so that program execution can continue.
For example, the following code attempts to write a file, but warns the user
and proceeds instead of terminating execution if the file cannot be written:

```julia
try

```julia
lines = try
    open("/danger", "r") do f
        readlines(f)
    end
catch
    @warn "File not found."
end
```

The syntax `catch e` (where `e` is any variable) assigns the thrown
exception object to the given variable within the `catch` block.

nested computation immediately to a much higher level in the stack of calling functions.

`;` has a similar role in Julia as in many C-like languages, and is used to delimit the
end of the previous statement. `;` is not necessary after new lines, but can be used to
separate statements on a single line or to join statements into a single expression.
`;` is also used to suppress output printing in the REPL and similar interfaces.

    ccall(function_name, returntype, (argtype1, ...), argvalue1, ...)
    ccall(function_pointer, returntype, (argtype1, ...), argvalue1, ...)

Call a function in a C-exported shared library, specified by the tuple `(function_name, library)`,
where each component is either a string or symbol. Instead of specifying a library,
one can also use a `function_name` symbol or string, which is resolved in the current process.
Alternatively, `ccall` may also be used to call a function pointer `function_pointer`, such as one returned by `dlsym`.

Note that the argument type tuple must be a literal tuple, and not a tuple-valued
variable or expression.

Each `argvalue` to the `ccall` will be converted to the corresponding
`argtype`, by automatic insertion of calls to `unsafe_convert(argtype,
cconvert(argtype, argvalue))`. (See also the documentation for
[`unsafe_convert`](@ref Base.unsafe_convert) and [`cconvert`](@ref Base.cconvert) for further details.)

  of the entry-point function to call;
- as a 2-element tuple, but with the module provided as an `Vector{UINt8}` with bitcode.

Note that contrary to `ccall`, the argument types must be specified as a tuple type, and not
a tuple of types. All types, as well as the LLVM code, should be specified as literals, and
not as variables or expressions (it may be necessary to use `@eval` to generate these

    begin

`begin...end` denotes a block of code.

```julia
begin
    println("Hello, ")
    println("World!")
end
```

Usually `begin` will not be necessary, since keywords such as [`function`](@ref) and [`let`](@ref)
implicitly begin blocks of code. See also [`;`](@ref).

`begin` may also be used when indexing to represent the first index of a
collection or the first index of a dimension of an array.

# Examples
```jldoctest
julia> A = [1 2; 3 4]

    struct

The most commonly used kind of type in Julia is a struct, specified as a name and a
set of fields.

```julia
struct Point
    x
    y
end
```

Fields can have type restrictions, which may be parameterized:

```julia
struct Point{X}
    x::X
    y::Float64
end
```

A struct can also declare an abstract super type via `<:` syntax:

```julia
struct Point <: AbstractPoint
    x
    y
end
```

`struct`s are immutable by default; an instance of one of these types cannot
be modified after construction. Use [`mutable struct`](@ref) instead to declare a
type whose instances can be modified.

See the manual section on [Composite Types](@ref) for more details,
such as how to define constructors.
"""
kw"struct"

    mutable struct

`mutable struct` is similar to [`struct`](@ref), but additionally allows the
fields of the type to be set after construction. See the manual section on

Special function available to inner constructors which created a new object

kw"new"

"""
    where

The `where` keyword creates a type that is an iterated union of other types, over all
values of some variable. For example `Vector{T} where T<:Real` includes all [`Vector`](@ref)s
where the element type is some kind of `Real` number.

The variable bound defaults to [`Any`](@ref) if it is omitted:

```julia
Vector{T} where T    # short for `where T<:Any`
```
Variables can also have lower bounds:

```julia
Vector{T} where T>:Int
Vector{T} where Int<:T<:Real
```
There is also a concise syntax for nested `where` expressions. For example, this:

```julia
Pair{T, S} where S<:Array{T} where T<:Number
```
can be shortened to:

```julia
Pair{T, S} where {T<:Number, S<:Array{T}}
```
This form is often found on method signatures.

Note that in this form, the variables are listed outermost-first. This matches the
order in which variables are substituted when a type is "applied" to parameter values
using the syntax `T{p1, p2, ...}`.
"""
kw"where"

    var

The syntax `var"#example#"` refers to a variable named `Symbol("#example#")`,
even though `#example#` is not a valid Julia identifier name.

This can be useful for interoperability with programming languages which have
different rules for the construction of valid identifiers. For example, to
refer to the `R` variable `draw.segments`, you can use `var"draw.segments"` in
your Julia code.

It is also used to `show` julia source code which has gone through macro
hygiene or otherwise contains variable names which can't be parsed normally.

Note that this syntax requires parser support so it is expanded directly by the
parser rather than being implemented as a normal string macro `@var_str`.

    Tuple{Types...}

Tuples are an abstraction of the arguments of a function – without the function itself. The salient aspects of
a function's arguments are their order and their types. Therefore a tuple type is similar to a parameterized
immutable type where each parameter is the type of one field. Tuple types may have any number of parameters.

Tuple types are covariant in their parameters: `Tuple{Int}` is a subtype of `Tuple{Any}`. Therefore `Tuple{Any}`
is considered an abstract type, and tuple types are only concrete if their parameters are. Tuples do not have
field names; fields are only accessed by index.
