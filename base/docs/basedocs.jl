    abstract type

`abstract type` declares a type that cannot be instantiated, and serves only as a node in the
type graph, thereby describing sets of related concrete types: those concrete types
which are their descendants. Abstract types form the conceptual hierarchy which makes
Julia’s type system more than just a collection of object implementations. For example:

```julia
abstract type Number end
abstract type Real <: Number end
```
[`Number`](@ref) has no supertype, whereas [`Real`](@ref) is an abstract subtype of `Number`.
"""

"""
    module

`module` declares a Module, which is a separate global variable workspace. Within a
module, you can control which names from other modules are visible (via importing), and
specify which of your names are intended to be public (via exporting).
Modules allow you to create top-level definitions without worrying about name conflicts
when your code is used together with somebody else’s.
See the [manual section about modules](@ref modules) for more details.

# Examples
```julia
module Foo
import Base.show
export MyType, foo

struct MyType
    x
end

bar(x) = 2x
foo(a::MyType) = bar(a.x) + 1
show(io::IO, a::MyType) = print(io, "MyType \$(a.x)")

    primitive type

`primitive type` declares a concrete type whose data consists only of a series of bits. Classic
examples of primitive types are integers and floating-point values. Some example built-in
primitive type declarations:

```julia
primitive type Char 32 end
primitive type Bool <: Integer 8 end
```
The number after the name indicates how many bits of storage the type requires. Currently,
only sizes that are multiples of 8 bits are supported.
The [`Bool`](@ref) declaration shows how a primitive type can be optionally
declared to be a subtype of some supertype.
"""
kw"primitive type"

"""
    macro

`macro` defines a method to include generated code in the final body of a program. A
macro maps a tuple of arguments to a returned expression, and the resulting expression
is compiled directly rather than requiring a runtime `eval` call. Macro arguments may
include expressions, literal values, and symbols. For example:

# Examples
```jldoctest
julia> macro sayhello(name)
           return :( println("Hello, ", \$name, "!") )
       end
@sayhello (macro with 1 method)

julia> @sayhello "Charlie"

`local` introduces a new local variable.

# Examples

               local x # introduce a loop-local x

"""
    let

`let` statements allocate new variable bindings each time they run. Whereas an
assignment modifies an existing value location, `let` creates new locations. This
difference is only detectable in the case of variables that outlive their scope via
closures. The `let` syntax accepts a comma-separated series of assignments and variable
names:

```julia
let var1 = value1, var2, var3 = value3
    code
end
```
The assignments are evaluated in order, with each right-hand side evaluated in the scope
before the new variable on the left-hand side has been introduced. Therefore it makes
sense to write something like `let x = x`, since the two `x` variables are distinct and
have separate storage.
"""
kw"let"

"""
    quote

`quote` creates multiple expression objects in a block without using the explicit `Expr`
constructor. For example:

```julia
ex = quote
    x = 1
    y = 2
    x + y
end
```
Unlike the other means of quoting, `:( ... )`, this form introduces `QuoteNode` elements
to the expression tree, which must be considered when directly manipulating the tree.
For other purposes, `:( ... )` and `quote .. end` blocks are treated identically.

    const

`const` is used to declare global variables which are also constant. In almost all code
(and particularly performance sensitive code) global variables should be declared
constant in this way.

```julia
const x = 5
```

Multiple variables can be declared within a single `const`:
```julia
const y, z = 7, 11
```

Note that "constant-ness" is not enforced inside containers, so if `x` is an array or
dictionary (for example) you can still add and remove elements.

Technically, you can even redefine `const` variables, although this will generate a
warning from the compiler. The only strict requirement is that the *type* of the
variable does not change, which is why `const` variables are much faster than regular
globals.
"""
kw"const"

"""
    function

Functions are defined with the `function` keyword:

```julia
function add(a, b)
    return a + b
end
```
Or the short form notation:

```julia
add(a, b) = a + b
```

The use of the [`return`](@ref) keyword is exactly the same as in other languages,
but is often optional. A function without an explicit `return` statement will return
the last expression in the function body.
"""
kw"function"

"""
    return

`return` can be used in function bodies to exit early and return a given value, e.g.

```julia
function compare(a, b)
    a == b && return "equal to"
    a < b ? "less than" : "greater than"
end
```
In general you can place a `return` statement anywhere within a function body, including
within deeply nested loops or conditionals, but be careful with `do` blocks. For
example:

```julia
function test1(xs)
    for x in xs
        iseven(x) && return 2x
    end
end

function test2(xs)
    map(xs) do x
        iseven(x) && return 2x
        x
    end
end
```
In the first example, the return breaks out of its enclosing function as soon as it hits
an even number, so `test1([5,6,7])` returns `12`.

You might expect the second example to behave the same way, but in fact the `return`
there only breaks out of the *inner* function (inside the `do` block) and gives a value
back to `map`. `test2([5,6,7])` then returns `[5,12,7]`.
"""
kw"return"

"""
    if/elseif/else

`if`/`elseif`/`else` performs conditional evaluation, which allows portions of code to
be evaluated or not evaluated depending on the value of a boolean expression. Here is
the anatomy of the `if`/`elseif`/`else` conditional syntax:

```julia
if x < y
    println("x is less than y")
elseif x > y
    println("x is greater than y")
else
    println("x is equal to y")
end
```
If the condition expression `x < y` is true, then the corresponding block is evaluated;
otherwise the condition expression `x > y` is evaluated, and if it is true, the
corresponding block is evaluated; if neither expression is true, the `else` block is
evaluated. The `elseif` and `else` blocks are optional, and as many `elseif` blocks as
desired can be used.

"""
    while

`while` loops repeatedly evaluate a conditional expression, and continues evaluating the

expression is false when the while loop is first reached, the body is never evaluated.

```jldoctest

`end` marks the conclusion of a block of expressions, for example
`module`, `struct`, `mutable struct`, `begin`, `let`, `for` etc.
`end` may also be used when indexing into an array to represent
the last index of a dimension.

# Examples
```jldoctest
julia> A = [1 2; 3 4]
2×2 Array{Int64,2}:
 1  2

    try/catch

A `try`/`catch` statement allows for `Exception`s to be tested for. For example, a
customized square root function can be written to automatically call either the real or
complex square root method on demand using `Exception`s:

```julia
f(x) = try
    sqrt(x)
catch
    sqrt(complex(x, 0))
end
```

`try`/`catch` statements also allow the `Exception` to be saved in a variable, e.g. `catch y`.

The `catch` clause is not strictly necessary; when omitted, the default return value is
`nothing`. The power of the `try`/`catch` construct lies in the ability to unwind a deeply
nested computation immediately to a much higher level in the stack of calling functions.
"""

"""
    finally

`finally` provides a way to run some code when a given block of code exits, regardless

closed:

```julia
f = open("file")
try
    operate_on_file(f)
finally
    close(f)
end
```

When control leaves the `try` block (for example due to a `return`, or just finishing
normally), `close(f)` will be executed. If the `try` block exits due to an exception,
the exception will continue propagating. A `catch` block may be combined with `try` and
`finally` as well. In this case the `finally` block will run after `catch` has handled
the error.

    struct

The most commonly used kind of type in Julia is a struct, specified as a name and a
set of fields.

```julia

A struct can also declare an abstract super type via `<:` syntax:

`struct`s are immutable by default; an instance of one of these types cannot

    where

The `where` keyword creates a type that is an iterated union of other types, over all

The variable bound defaults to `Any` if it is omitted:

Variables can also have lower bounds:

```julia
Vector{T} where T>:Int

There is also a concise syntax for nested `where` expressions. For example, this:

```julia

    invoke(f, argtypes::Type, args...; kwargs...)

Invoke a method for the given generic function `f` matching the specified types `argtypes` on the
specified arguments `args` and passing the keyword arguments `kwargs`. The arguments `args` must
conform with the specified types in `argtypes`, i.e. conversion is not automatically performed.
This method allows invoking a method other than the most specific matching method, which is useful
when the behavior of a more general definition is explicitly needed (often as part of the
implementation of a more specific method of the same function).

# Examples
```jldoctest
julia> f(x::Real) = x^2;

julia> f(x::Integer) = 1 + invoke(f, Tuple{Real}, x);

julia> f(2)

    Tuple{Types...}

Tuples are an abstraction of the arguments of a function – without the function itself. The salient aspects of
a function's arguments are their order and their types. Therefore a tuple type is similar to a parameterized
immutable type where each parameter is the type of one field. Tuple types may have any number of parameters.

Tuple types are covariant in their parameters: `Tuple{Int}` is a subtype of `Tuple{Any}`. Therefore `Tuple{Any}`
is considered an abstract type, and tuple types are only concrete if their parameters are. Tuples do not have
field names; fields are only accessed by index.
