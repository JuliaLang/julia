    DEPOT_PATH

A stack of "depot" locations where the package manager, as well as Julia's code
loading mechanisms, look for package registries, installed packages, named
environments, repo clones, cached compiled package images, and configuration
files. By default it includes:

1. `~/.julia` where `~` is the user home as appropriate on the system;
2. an architecture-specific shared system directory, e.g. `/usr/local/share/julia`;
3. an architecture-independent shared system directory, e.g. `/usr/share/julia`.

So `DEPOT_PATH` might be:
```julia
[joinpath(homedir(), ".julia"), "/usr/local/share/julia", "/usr/share/julia"]
```
The first entry is the "user depot" and should be writable by and owned by the
current user. The user depot is where: registries are cloned, new package versions
are installed, named environments are created and updated, package repos are cloned,
newly compiled package image files are saved, log files are written, development
packages are checked out by default, and global configuration data is saved. Later
entries in the depot path are treated as read-only and are appropriate for
registries, packages, etc. installed and managed by system administrators.

`DEPOT_PATH` is populated based on the [`JULIA_DEPOT_PATH`](@ref JULIA_DEPOT_PATH)
environment variable if set.

#  - the first three `#`s in a named environment are replaced with version numbers
#  - `@stdlib` is a special name for the standard library and expands to its path

# if you want a current env setup, use direnv and
# have your .envrc do something like this:
#
#   export JULIA_LOAD_PATH="$(pwd):$JULIA_LOAD_PATH"
#
# this will inherit an existing JULIA_LOAD_PATH value or if there is none, leave
# a trailing empty entry in JULIA_LOAD_PATH which will be replaced with defaults.

"""
    LOAD_PATH

An array of paths for `using` and `import` statements to consider as project
environments or package directories when loading code. It is populated based on
the [`JULIA_LOAD_PATH`](@ref JULIA_LOAD_PATH) environment variable if set;
otherwise it defaults to `["@", "@v#.#", "@stdlib"]`. Entries starting with `@`
have special meanings:

- `@` refers to the "current active environment", the initial value of which is
  initially determined by the [`JULIA_PROJECT`](@ref JULIA_PROJECT) environment
  variable or the `--project` command-line option.

- `@stdlib` expands to the absolute path of the current Julia installation's
  standard library directory.

- `@name` refers to a named environment, which are stored in depots (see
  [`JULIA_DEPOT_PATH`](@ref JULIA_DEPOT_PATH)) under the `environments`
  subdirectory. The user's named environments are stored in
  `~/.julia/environments` so `@name` would refer to the environment in
  `~/.julia/environments/name` if it exists and contains a `Project.toml` file.
  If `name` contains `#` characters, then they are replaced with the major, minor
  and patch components of the Julia version number. For example, if you are
  running Julia 1.2 then `@v#.#` expands to `@v1.2` and will look for an
  environment by that name, typically at `~/.julia/environments/v1.2`.

The fully expanded value of `LOAD_PATH` that is searched for projects and packages
can be seen by calling the `Base.load_path()` function.
