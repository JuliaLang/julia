To build the Julia.app OS X application bundle:

1. First install Winston, and compile all the relevant libraries with Pkg.add("Winston"). The libraries are copied from ~/.julia/{Cairo,Tk} in here.
2. Make sure Platypus is installed with its command line tool (from Platypus Preferences)
3. Run `make` here to create a self-sufficient julia distribution with Cairo and Tk.

The `julia.icns` file provides the Julia icon, and the `script` file launches julia in a terminal.
