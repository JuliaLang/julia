Julia OS X packaging
====================

This builds the Julia OS X application bundle (.app folder), and stores it in a disk image (.dmg file).

Run `make` to build these files.

Other files in this directory

* `startup.applescript` is compiled to an applet which launches Julia in Terminal.app.
* `julia.icns` is the Julia icon file.
