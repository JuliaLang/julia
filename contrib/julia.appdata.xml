   Julia is a high-level, high-performance dynamic programming language for
   technical computing, with syntax that is familiar to users of other
   technical computing environments. It provides a sophisticated compiler,
   distributed parallel execution, numerical accuracy, and an extensive
   mathematical function library.
  </p>
  <p>
   The library, largely written in Julia itself,
   also integrates mature, best-of-breed C and Fortran libraries for linear
   algebra, random number generation, signal processing, and string processing.
   In addition, the Julia developer community is contributing a number of
   external packages through Juliaâ€™s built-in package manager at a rapid pace.
