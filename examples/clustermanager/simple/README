This is a simple proof-of-concept that uses UNIX domain sockets as transport.

All commands must be run from `examples/clustermanager/simple` directory

Start a Julia REPL and type:
    include("UnixDomainCM.jl") 
    addprocs(UnixDomainCM(4)) # start with four workers

Alternatively, head.jl, a test script could be run. It just launches the requested number of workers,
executes a simple command on all of them and exits.
    julia head.jl 4
